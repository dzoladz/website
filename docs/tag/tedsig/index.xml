    &lt;strong&gt;Speculative Library Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries&lt;/strong&gt; is the culmination of a yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alaoweb.org/igs/tedsig/index.html/&#34;&gt;TEDSIG&lt;/a&gt;, the Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alaoweb.org/&#34;&gt;Academic Library Association of Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://futures.alaoweb.org/notes-on-a-speculative-design-reading-group.html/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Notes on a Speculative Design Reading Group&lt;/a&gt; by John Jung reflects on the conversations with artists, designers, and librarians that emerged during “Design After the End of the World”, a speculative design reading group at Chicago’s community lab LATITUDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://futures.alaoweb.org/tech-to-you.html/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tech to You&lt;/a&gt; by Myiesha Speight and Bria Sinnott accepts the disintegration of the library as a physical place to explore fundamental questions about the qualifications of librarianship and the definition of impactful public services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://futures.alaoweb.org/alexandria.html/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alexandr.ia&lt;/a&gt; by Calvin Cleary and Liz Lang is a dystopian look at the future of precarity in academic libraries, which takes the form of a satirical pitch to Silicon Valley investors for an app called Alexandr.ia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of this work finds its roots just off of exit 50, southbound interstate 70, in a rural Holiday Inn. It was a late October afternoon – at an oddly remote conference center in Wilmington, Ohio.  I was listening to a presentation from &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnjung.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John Jung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://kzadrozny.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kathy Zadrozny&lt;/a&gt;, both from the University of Chicago, about the use of design fiction – specifically, the creation of believable near-future stories to explore the social, cultural and ethical aspects of technological change. The year was 2016 and this presentation made a deep and lasting impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to 2018, when I became co-chair of TEDSIG in July. Taking the interest group in a fresh direction was an intentional decision. Rather than continue to facilitate workshops and schedule learning opportunities that focused on the day-to-day tooling that enables library-specific technical work, I wanted to use this opportunity to reinvigorate our group by reflecting on first principles and foundations. Accepting that many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness served as a premise to encourage us to consider alternative futures. However, to avoid a future that merely recapitulates both the positive and negative aspects of our present solutions, we needed to think critically about the design of our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;futures_cone.png&#34; alt=&#34;diagram of the future cones&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tedsig.alaoweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TEDSIG 2020&lt;/a&gt; invited John Jung to present an hour-long exploration of Speculative/Critical Design and Libraries. Speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being, where traditional design attempts to solve problems. Speculative design holds promise for libraries as a way to problematize our present by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality. Thomas Moynihan: &amp;ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future&amp;rdquo;. It is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of TEDSIG 2020 were invited to continue the exploration by participating in an 8-week speculative design and climate reading group co-facilitated by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reneelynn.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Renee Albrecht-Mallinger&lt;/a&gt; and John Jung. Beginning in September 2020, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzoladz.github.io/2020-reading-group/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Design After the End of the World&lt;/a&gt; was hosted by the artist community space &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latitudechicago.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LATITUDE | Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. The outcome of this group’s work resulted in the call for proposals for a Speculative Library Futures web-based publication, of which the resulting contributions are included above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Design After the End of the World</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the success of &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedsig.alaoweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TEDSIG|2020&lt;/a&gt;, TEDSIG membership was invited to participate in a speculative design reading group. Lead by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reneelynn.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Renee Albrecht-Mallinger&lt;/a&gt; - a design strategist, storyteller, educator, and futurist useing human-centered design methods to address problems of all sizes - and &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnjung.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;John Jung&lt;/a&gt; - a computer programmer and design methods workshop facilitator, the &amp;ldquo;Design After the End of the World: Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group&amp;rdquo; was opened for registration. In partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latitudechicago.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LATITUDE&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit community digital lab in Chicago, the 10 person reading group meet each Thursday, from 6:30-8:30pm CT, between September 3rd and October 22nd to discuss the weekly readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;syllabus&#34;&gt;Syllabus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an introduction to the breadth of speculative design, the reading group investigated: the work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://superflux.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Superflux&lt;/a&gt;, read selections from Amitav Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Great Derangement&lt;/em&gt; and Stewart Brand&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Clock of the Long Now: Time and Responsibility​&lt;/em&gt;, explored games as a method for idea generation and rapid prototyping, and shared our interpretations and analysis each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to review an &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzoladz.github.io/2020-reading-group/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;archive of the syllabus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with TEDSIG 2020 in July, and continued through an inspired Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group with LATITUDE, the culmination of this yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries was formulated into a call for proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://futures.alaoweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Speculative Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Futures are not a destination, but a medium for imaginative thought&amp;rdquo; - Anthony Dunne &amp;amp; Fiona Raby&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might consider post-pandemic libraries to be behind us, or immediately facing us; or, perhaps they&amp;rsquo;re far beyond any near-term horizon. Remote, distant, or extending through centuries into a yet-unimagined future. &amp;lsquo;Post-pandemic&amp;rsquo; is an intentionally nebulous frame of reference, affording almost instantaneous, molecular futures, while simultaneously opening a fissure in contemporary reality: an opportunity for the as-of-yet-unthought-of to be released unto the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/dzoladz/tedsig-futures/blob/master/futures_cone.png?raw=true&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;  Attribution: &lt;a href=&#34;https://thevoroscope.com/2017/02/24/the-futures-cone-use-and-history/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Joseph Voros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This call for proposals seeks submissions for a web-based publication. The finished product will be similar to walking through a curated exhibit at an art gallery, where each contribution stands on its own as a work of art, but together, create an object for reflecting upon our present-day library and information practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome proposals from underrepresented groups, including but not limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQ+, ability/disability, and non-binary gender identities. We also invite proposals from members of underrepresented and/or marginalized groups that don&amp;rsquo;t fit into the categories listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential contributions might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photoessays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawings/sketches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Film/trailer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cautionary tales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software/code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object from the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postcards that travel back in time to us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maps or other fictional cartography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectural designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dataset from the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short stories, theatrical spaces, movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A manifesto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of an activist event/protest from the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News of a cataclysmic event that serves as a tipping point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading lists for yet-to-be-written works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals will be accepted until &lt;strong&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/strong&gt; and the finished exhibition is slated to be published in late &lt;strong&gt;March, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Speculative Design &amp; Libraries</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Co-Chair of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alaoweb.org/igs/tedsig/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group&lt;/a&gt; (TEDSIG) - a community within the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) - my professional experiences have circumvented the shared set of historical struggles that define the group&amp;rsquo;s identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TEDSIG was founded in 1993 as the Technical Services Interest Group (TSIG). The interest group’s name and scope was changed in June 2007 to Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group (TEDSIG) to better reflect the evolving status of the group’s constituents in traditional and emerging technologies. By the time that I began working at Columbus State Community College in 2008, it was evidently clear that the traditional role of technical service librarians was on the decline. As a new professional with a bias towards the use of technology in day-to-day library practices, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why - or how -  the technological aspects of the profession were&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;on the way out&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main co-chair responsibilities is to organize an annual event for members of the TEDSIG community. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to contribute to both the growth, and the future direction, of the group. Pondering the overwhelming emptiness of &amp;lsquo;what to do&amp;rsquo; with this tabla rasa, I explored the confusion of my early experiences of technical work in libraries. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that technological work in libraries was on the way out, it was that &lt;em&gt;a specific way of conducting that technical work was on the way out&lt;/em&gt;. As I&amp;rsquo;m joining the ranks of the mid-career professionals, this gave me pause. As members of Ohio&amp;rsquo;s TEDSIG community, are we actively designing a future for the next generation of library professionals to step into?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help us explore the design implications of our current and potential library futures, John Jung was invited to speak at TEDSIG 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;john_jung.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;photo of John Jung&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Jung is Design Consultant at &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnjung.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;johnjung.us&lt;/a&gt; and Programmer/Analyst at The University of Chicago. John is interested in the different ways that research and design might intersect. He has recently spoken on Speculative Design &amp;amp; Strategy at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnjung.us/scd_and_strategy.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Symposium on the Future of Libraries&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle, Washington, as well as having lead the provocatively-titled reading group &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latitudechicago.org/classes-and-workshops/reading-group-design-after-the-end-of-the-world&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Design After the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; in his hometown of Chicago. He has a degree in art from Governors State University and a degree in design methods from the IIT Institute of Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative and Critical Design and Libraries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Moynihan once noted: &amp;ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future&amp;rdquo;. If nothing else, this statement gives us pause. Just enough of a delay to remove us from immediacy. Allowing us to bring our set of expectations and assumptions to the foreground and reflect upon how these projections of a near-term reality guide our decision-making in the present. As many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, the struggle is real. To avoid a future that merely recapitulates - both the positive and negative aspects of - our present solutions, we need to think critically about the design of our future. But maybe more so, we need a toolkit to problematize our present. To shake loose our assumptions, and provide just enough distance to consider alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where Speculative Design is useful. Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being. If it is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward, speculative design has promise as a way to allow us to problematize our present, so as not to repeat our past, by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

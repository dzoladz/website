      <description>Lots of Firsts at Code{4}lib 2020 Code{4}lib is the only major conference that I&amp;rsquo;ve attend that&amp;rsquo;s had a single track which all attendees experience. At most conferences, attendees experience the same keynote presentation to kick-off the event, but then develop a self-selected path through multiple, simultaneously occurring presentations. When all attendees experience the same sessions, lightening talks, breakouts, and keynotes, there&amp;rsquo;s a definitively stronger sense of community that emerges. There&amp;rsquo;s also a deeper understanding of each topic that develops, as attendees discuss sessions over breakfast and snack breaks through the filters of their own local context and professional focus.</description>

      <description>Lots of Firsts at Code{4}lib 2020 Code{4}lib is the only major conference that I&amp;rsquo;ve attend with a single track. Most conferences are multi-track. At a multi-track conference, attendees gather for a keynote presentation to kick-off the event. But after that collective experience, everyone develops a self-selected path through simultaneously occurring presentations and activities. At Code{4}lib, all attendees experience the same sequence of sessions, lightning talks, breakouts, and keynotes presentations. There&amp;rsquo;s a definitively stronger sense of community that emerges with a single-track conference.</description>

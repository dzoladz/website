      <title>code{4}lib - Pittsburgh, PA</title>

      <description>Lots of Firsts at Code{4}lib 2020 Code{4}lib is the only major conference that I&amp;rsquo;ve attend with a single track. Most conferences are multi-track. At a multi-track conference, attendees gather for a keynote presentation to kick-off the event. But after that collective experience, everyone develops a self-selected path through simultaneously occurring presentations and activities. At Code{4}lib, all attendees experience the same sequence of sessions, lightning talks, breakouts, and keynotes presentations. There&amp;rsquo;s a definitively stronger sense of community that emerges with a single-track conference.</description>

      <description>While it&amp;rsquo;s a major challenge to identify all of the scripts, command line tools, and web-based applications that have influenced my thoughts and workflow over the previous year, here&amp;rsquo;s a set of applications that I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take with me into the new year.
Joplin
Built upon node.js and electron, Joplin is an open source note taking application. At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m using it as a well-structured notebook to recall quotes and collect ideas of all sorts.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s definitely an argument to be made for using lightweight apps that minimize installed dependencies in an effort to: (1) minimize the surface area for vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and (2) reduce application complexity for troubleshooting purposes when something inevitably goes wrong. However, there needs to be a balance between security gains and pleasure in using an application, what&amp;rsquo;s the point in installing it in the first place if you aren&amp;rsquo;t going to use it?</description>

      <title>Overview of My Personal Library</title>

      <description>On a day-to-day basis, I work with the Consortium of Ohio Libraries on their open-source ILS Evergreen. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s configuring new circulation policies, adjusting global system settings, or writing SQL to batch update item attributes, I&amp;rsquo;ve explored a significant chunk of Evergreen over the last 3 years. But it&amp;rsquo;s an understatment to say that Evergreen is a massive application. There&amp;rsquo;s still plenty of uncharted functionality.
Evergreen&amp;rsquo;s architecture is designed for multi-tenancy out-of-the-box and built to scale to very large consortia.</description>

      <title>Why ls is exa</title>

      <description>One of the most common commands that I execute in the terminal is simply to list the contents of a directory. Since I do this so often, being able to quickly and easily digest vast amounts of information about the content of the directory is essential. That&amp;rsquo;s where exa shines.
Out-of-the-box, the default color scheme of exa is finely tuned. I found the intricate use of subtle color distinctions distracting, rather than informative.</description>

      <title>Farewell, Nano</title>

      <description>Forever, I&amp;rsquo;ve used nano as my command-line text editor. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had an issue with it. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s been so reliable that I&amp;rsquo;ve keep it around much longer than I should have. It still works well for most of my needs, but it&amp;rsquo;s time to expand my suite of skills and learn something new.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m switching to vim.
Out-of-the-box, vim is a tabula rasa, a blank slate, and it feels oddly empty.</description>

      <description>I should probably start off with a bit of a caveat.
Okay. Now that we have that out of the way, here are a few of the apps that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered over the last 365 days that I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking with me into 2019.
PyCharm
PyCharm is a Python IDE with an extensive collection of plugins. I&amp;rsquo;m using the community edition to develop Python scripts in support the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, mainly to interact with the Evergreen ILS.</description>

      <description>Participating in the early group for the technical infrastructure for this project - simply called &amp;lsquo;DPLA Ohio&amp;rsquo; at the time - shaped the trajectory of my career firmly towards technology. Check out the State Library of Ohio&amp;rsquo;s announcement.
And the, visit the Ohio Digital Network!</description>

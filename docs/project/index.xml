      <description>Speculative Library Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries is the culmination of a yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries by TEDSIG, the Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group of the Academic Library Association of Ohio.    Publication: Speculative Library Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries doi: doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4606860   Speculative Card Deck by Mackenzie Salisbury and Shannon Marie Robinson integrates Guy Debord&amp;rsquo;s dérive into a beautifully-designed, critical deck of prompts and actions to generate situations that disrupt the traditional use value assigned to the library.</description>

      <description>As Co-Chair of the Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group (TEDSIG) - a community within the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) - my professional experiences have circumvented the shared set of historical struggles that define the group&amp;rsquo;s identity.
TEDSIG was founded in 1993 as the Technical Services Interest Group (TSIG). The interest group’s name and scope was changed in June 2007 to Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group (TEDSIG) to better reflect the evolving status of the group’s constituents in traditional and emerging technologies.</description>

      <description>Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court was an interactive exhibit at the Columbus State Library in 2015. Posters were brought to life using the augmented reality app Aurasma.
 &amp;ldquo;Using emerging technology, team members created the exhibit and online guide that was enjoyed and appreciated by the community, ranging from 5th graders to local business leaders. With the help of many collaborators, the team went beyond the exhibit to create a wide range of programs including a film series, an art exhibit, a lecture series, and a companion display and programming in the Bookstore.</description>

      <description>Ohio’s first ILEAD USA was a multi-state immersive continuing education program that develops library leaders through projects based on community needs via the application of participatory technology tools. Ohio participants joined others from Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, and Utah in this national initiative. ILEAD USA was funded by a Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program grant to the State Library of Illinois from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
Myself, and a former CSCC colleague Julie Zaveloff, were selected as part of the initial group from Ohio.</description>

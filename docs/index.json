It was a late October afternoon – at an oddly remote conference center in Wilmington, Ohio. I was listening to a presentation from John Jung and Kathy Zadrozny, both from the University of Chicago, about the use of design fiction – specifically, the creation of believable near-future stories to explore the social, cultural and ethical aspects of technological change. The year was 2016 and this presentation made a deep and lasting impression on me.\n ©2021 OpenStreetMap Contributors | ODbL 1.0 license  Fast-forward to 2018, when I became co-chair of TEDSIG in July. Taking the interest group in a fresh direction was an intentional decision. Rather than continue to facilitate workshops and schedule learning opportunities that focused on the day-to-day tooling that enables library-specific technical work, I wanted to use this opportunity to reinvigorate our group by reflecting on first principles and foundations. Accepting that many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness served as a premise to encourage us to consider alternative futures. However, to avoid a future that merely recapitulates both the positive and negative aspects of our present solutions, we needed to think critically about the design of our future.\nTEDSIG 2020 invited John Jung to present an hour-long exploration of Speculative/Critical Design and Libraries. Speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being, where traditional design attempts to solve problems. Speculative design holds promise for libraries as a way to problematize our present by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality. Thomas Moynihan: \u0026ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future\u0026rdquo;. It is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward.\n \u0026ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future\u0026rdquo;\n Attendees of TEDSIG 2020 were invited to continue the exploration by participating in an 8-week speculative design and climate reading group co-facilitated by Renee Albrecht-Mallinger and John Jung. Beginning in September 2020, Design After the End of the World was hosted by the artist community space LATITUDE | Chicago. The outcome of this group’s work resulted in the call for proposals for a Speculative Library Futures web-based publication, of which the resulting contributions are included above.\n","date":1615766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615766400,"objectID":"798be37cc9e4c3391650f30751f868e3","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig_futures/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tedsig_futures/","section":"project","summary":"A yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries by TEDSIG","tags":["technology","TEDSIG","ALAO"],"title":"Speculative Library Futures","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" While it\u0026rsquo;s a major challenge to identify all of the scripts, command line tools, and web-based applications that have influenced my thoughts and workflow over the previous year, here\u0026rsquo;s a set of applications that I\u0026rsquo;m excited to take with me into the new year.\nWax Using minimal computing principles, Wax is a project that aims to facilitate the creation of digital exhibits using static site technologies. For librarians exploring digital technologies at cash-strapped institutions without a formal digital initiatives program, Wax is a lightweight and cheap (in terms of cost and maintenance) solution.\nInitially, there\u0026rsquo;s a rather significant technical hurdle, but the skills can be easily repurposed for use in other data-intensive projects, web development using static sites, and other metadata or library-adjacent workflows. Here are a few of the underpinning of Wax:\n         Jekyll Static Site Generator   SCSS CSS Pre-processer   Bundler Gem Dependency Management   Liquid Templating Language   YAML Data Serialization Standard   Bootstrap Front-End Frameworks   Ruby Programming Language   Markdown Plain-Text Markup Language   JSON Data Interchange Format   Git Software Version Control   Github Pages Static Site Hosting Service    It\u0026rsquo;s also a great way to learn about the International Image Interoperability Framework™ [a.k.a iiif or \u0026ldquo;Triple-I-F\u0026rdquo;] and its associated manifest files and viewer applications like Mirador and OpenSeadragon. Until I started using Wax, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t considered full-text search in Javascript, which Wax provide via Elasticlunr.js.\n Wax Workflow ⟶ see [documentation]  To get acquainted with the Wax workflow, a photographed several of my few favorite book covers from my personal collection and created an exhibit space called the CuriousitariumDCZ.\n Example: Book Cover Exhibit Using Wax  graphviz Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains.\nWriting diagrams using a familiar syntax - and working in an IDE, text editor, or any another code-like environment - just feels comfortably at home. Here\u0026rsquo;s the .dot file that generates the graph below contextualizing-ezproxy.dot\n Resultant Graphs are Crisply-defined and Visually Appealing  It also makes it easy to drop in a Python utility script that takes the .dot input and generates a visual representation as a .png file\u0026hellip; which can be quickly and easily integrated into presentation software or any number of other productivity applications.\nfrom graphviz import Source import os input_file = 'contextualizing-ezproxy' + '.dot' output_file = 'contextualizing-ezproxy' + '.png' os.system('dot -Tpng ' + input_file + ' -o ' + output_file) source = Source.from_file(input_file) source.view()  Here are a few tools to explore:\n Graphviz application use case - Contextualizing EZproxy, OhioLINK Webinar Slides No installation required online tool - Web-based Dot File Editor Quick start .dot cheat sheet - Graphviz Reference Documentation  Pa11y Dashboard Pa11y Dashboard is a web-based user interface for the underlying Pa11y accessibility reporting service. The dashboard simplifies the process of actively and continuously monitoring the accessibility status of a library\u0026rsquo;s service platforms.\nPa11y is an open source tool for running automated accessibility tests. Pa11y supports several common accessibility standards, including the W3C\u0026rsquo;s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG2A, WCAG2AA, or WCAG2AAA) and the United States GSA Section 508 standards. The aXe-core rule set is Pa11y\u0026rsquo;s default test runner suite.\n Example Dashboard  If you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Docker, you can clone the following GitHub repository and have a working version of Pa11y Dashboard in 5 minutes!\nTraefik Proxy One of my goals for 2020 was to create a small scale application hosting platform, where I could continue my exploration into the use of containerized applications within libraries and cultural heritage institutions. In early June, a working prototype was up-and-running on a general purpose t3.large EC2 instance. Code named, Esmeralda.\nEsmeralda is a platform for running containerized applications behind the enterprise-class reverse proxy Traefik. Containers are orchestrated via docker-compose files and Portainer is used to provide a graphical interface into the entire environment.\n Diagram of Basic Traefik Workflows  Traefik proxy handles:\n HTTP request resolution to each container service SSL termination SSL certificate issuance, renewal, and installation via Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt  Traefik also provides a suite of middleware to upgrade connections to HTTPS, provide basic authentication services, among many other functions. Traefik instructions can be written directly into an application\u0026rsquo;s docker-compose file, which means Traefik can configure itself automatically and dynamically as new containerized applications are deployed to Esmeralda.\nngrok ngrok is a cross-platform application that enables a locally-hosted web server to be exposed to the internet. Installing ngrok on the host machine is quick and simple. Once you specify the listening port of the web server, the ngrok client will: (1) initiate a secure connection to the ngrok server, (2) create a TCP tunnel on an .ngrok.io subdomain, and (3) route all HTTP traffic hitting the unique ngrok address to the specified port of your local host\u0026hellip; essentially bypassing firewall restrictions and NAT mappings to expose your local machine to the internet.

Conferences with pricey registration fees or cost-prohibitive for travel reasons have become real opportunities, as library and library-adjacent conferences and workshops transition to online delivery. I\u0026rsquo;ve registered for three times as many conference as I would in a typical year, but I\u0026rsquo;ve also not attended most of those events. When the event actually gets here, there\u0026rsquo;s always other work that I find a better use my time. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s a consequence of free registration - although I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it has been possible for so many organizations to offer free registration for their online events this year. There are plenty of tangible costs associated with a delivery of a fully online conference. Anyway\u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s all a divergence from the intent of this post, which is to reflect upon my work for the 2020 ALAO Conference\nAs the great learning of 2020 continues to bloom, a second upside has been the number of opportunities that have been granted to me to put the complete spectrum of my technical abilities into practice. While unexpected, serving as the Chair of the Website Working Group and Technical Lead for the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) annual conference - ALAO\u0026rsquo;s first ever fully online conference - has been a highlight for me.\nLeading the Website Working Group was a wonderful opportunity to:\n [1] expand the technical capacity and web property portfolio of ALAO [2] establish a GitHub organization to warehouse and share useful scripts and application code between ALAO members [3] obtain a non-profit Slack account for the organization, with additional features and increased limits and, [4] apply for an open source project account with Netlify to host application deployments for the 2020 conference website.  Volunteer projects like this one always provide an opportunity to exercise and develop my leadership abilities, mentor younger colleagues, and further enrich and solidify my project management capabilities.\nTeam Members of the 2020 Website Working Group are as follows:\n David W. Green (State Library of Ohio) Melissa Hill (Ohio Wesleyan University) Ken Irwin (Miami University) Ryan Scott (Columbus State Community College) Zach Walton (The Ohio State University)  The Website Working Group was responsible for applying the overall conference theme to the website, while adding features and functionality to the source code as gaps were discovered or a new set of needs arose. One of our stated goals was to make the site more plug-and-play for next year\u0026rsquo;s teams. We did this by replacing any hardcoded values throughout the source code with a centrally-located set of variables. In fact, the majority of variables controlling the website\u0026rsquo;s behavior and internal logic are contained in a single file at this point. Ideally, this will result in vastly reduced development times for next year\u0026rsquo;s conference website.\nOver the course of building the website, our primary method of communication was the #conference-website channel of the ALAO Slack workspace. Idea exchange, quick triage, and fast feedback were a breeze via Slack. Complex troubleshooting and issues requiring more in-depth discussion were held at our regularly scheduled meeting. Project management was mainly facilitated through Github’s native tooling, via issue creation, issue assignment of responsibilities, and a wiki for setting the agenda for our regular meetings.\nOur team worked in 3-week sprints over the course of a few months to bring the conference site together. Each sprint would begin with an hour-long meeting to review our progress, discuss any open issues, and set goals and priorities for the next sprint. Since our team was a combination of experienced developers and some folks who were entirely new to static site generators and source code versioning tools, the 3-week pace worked out surprisingly well for the whole team. For the less experienced members of the team, there was enough cushion to begin to explore the source code, generate a list of initial questions, and pursue self-guided learning to get up-to-speed\u0026hellip; while keeping just enough momentum under the project for the more experienced team members to maintain interest and continue to drive the project forward. Unfortunately, there are far too few hands-on mentorship opportunities for librarians to build a rich depth of technical knowledge that rivals the expertise of information technology staff. For the members of the Website Working Group, the experience of sharing knowledge and hard skills during the development of the conference website will slowly manifest in the comprehensiveness and degree of digital projects at each team member\u0026rsquo;s local institution.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that I underestimated the time commitment required to complete this project by roughly 30 hours. I anticipated 60 hours, but the actual time was closer to 90 hours. Although a considerable portion of the additional time occurred due to adding features and functionality that were not envisioned at the onset of the project, it\u0026rsquo;s a reminder to myself to do a better job controlling the scope of the project or padding my estimates a bit more generously to allow for some expansion as the project matures.\n➜ 2020.alaoweb.org git:(master) git-fame --cost hours Processing: 100%|███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 480/480 [00:31\u0026lt;00:00, 15.32file/s] Total commits: 831 Total ctimes: 2866 Total files: 377 Total hours: 89.2 Total loc: 505996 | Author | hrs | loc | coms | fils | distribution | |:----------------|------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|:----------------| | dzoladz | 51 | 475569 | 445 | 252 | 94.0/53.5/66.8 | | Ken Irwin | 27 | 29319 | 261 | 100 | 5.8/31.4/26.5 | | Zach Walton | 2 | 785 | 13 | 4 | 0.2/ 1.6/ 1.1 | | davidg | 3 | 253 | 16 | 16 | 0.1/ 1.9/ 4.2 | | Nassaubound | 2 | 68 | 16 | 4 | 0.0/ 1.9/ 1.1 | | David W.

Ken\u0026rsquo;s expertise helped the team to resolve several difficult challenges along the way, that otherwise, would have resulted in a less-than-ideal compromise.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled that Ken Irwin will be the Technical Lead for the ALAO 2021, Website Working Group 🎉\nTools \u0026amp; Services There are many all-inclusive virtual conference platforms that have sprouted up over the previous year or so (hopin, Remo, and Whova to namecheck a few that immediately come to mind). However, there are a few reasons that you might be inclined to roll-your-own assemblage of services to host a virtual conference.\nFirst | Minimizing Duplicate Service Costs\nIf you already purchase several of the needed components to host a virtual conference, why make a redundant purchase? As an example, ALAO has a professional subscription to the association management platform - Wild Apricot. Interacting with Wild Apricot is a familiar experience for ALAO membership, and Wild Apricot has a built-in event registration features, making it an obvious choice for handling conference registrations and payment options.\nSecond | Building Capacity and Encouraging Participation\nBuilding your organization\u0026rsquo;s overall technical capacity can encourage the expansion of services and opportunities made available to membership. While hard skills take time to develop, knowledge sharing and mentorship of colleagues are immediate, and lasting, benefits for the entire organization. Strengthening the sense of internal community can encourage members to take risks, become leaders, and pursue open positions as they become available.\nThird | Offset Contractual Losses\nIf your organization has a multi-year contract with a venue to hold the annual conference, and COVID-19 requires the cancellation of any face-to-face events for the year, you may still be contractually-obligated to pay a hefty cancellation fee. To minimize organizational losses, \u0026ldquo;Doing it on the cheap\u0026rdquo; may become the motto for the year.\nAlthough the underpinning of the 2020 ALAO conference website were built upon an abandoned? project for the 2014 GDG Devfest, i.e. Project Zeppelin, designing a virtual conference requires a careful selection of technologies and hosted services to be properly configured and skillfully aligned in a parallel direction. When you organization\u0026rsquo;s membership very clearly sees the annual conference as the value of - and primary reason for renewing - their membership, doing it on your own is not a decision to take lightly.\nTools One of the key considerations in making the decision to take the DIY approach is whether or not your organization has someone willing and - perhaps most importantly - able to take the lead for the project. The project lead will need to allocate considerable volunteer time, have solid communication and project management fundamentals, and posses an intermediate set of technical skills. Below is a list of the development tools and technologies that were required to develop the 2020 ALAO Conference. [source code]\n         Jekyll Static Site Generator   SCSS CSS Pre-processer   Bundler Gem Dependency Management   Liquid Templating Language   YAML Data Serialization Standard   Bootstrap Front-End Frameworks   Ruby Programming Language   Ruby Gems Ruby Packages (Applications or Libraries)   ImageOptum Lossless Image Optimization   Markdown Plain-Text Markup Language   JSON Data Interchange Format   Git Software Version Control    Of course, there are a number of others (i.e. JavaScript, jQuery) peppered in here and there, but the above is a list of the major components.\nServices Below is a best effort to list the services that were used to create the 2020 ALAO Conference. Each listed component contains a brief description of how it was used during the conference.\nZoom\nBecause of its overall familiarity to Ohio\u0026rsquo;s higher education community, and much-less-so based upon the merits of its feature set and functionality, a decision was made to use Zoom as our streaming platform for the conference.\nPrior to this decision, the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) already maintained an annual subscription to Zoom. This subscription was used to facilitate monthly board meetings and for one-off use by ALAO\u0026rsquo;s many interest groups. Because there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a need for additional capacity for the organization as a whole, the Website Working Group elected to purchase a separate, temporary, month-to-month subscription to Zoom, which was used exclusively for conference events. Our temporary subscription included two host licenses and two large meeting add-ons, as we anticipated 100+ attendees at the opening keynote, closing keynote, and annual awards ceremony. While we ultimately purchased the temporary subscription for two months, we could have easily reduced the duration to a single month.\nZoom was used for all real-time events, including the pre-conference workshop, trivia night, awards, and the opening and closing keynotes. As these real-time sessions were critical components of a successful conference - and we were dependent upon our notoriously unreliable home wifi connections (i.e. those pandemic work-from-home scenarios) - the two Zoom licenses were used in a host/alternative-host model. That way, if the meeting host\u0026rsquo;s cat disconnected the internet connection in the middle of a keynote, the meeting would seamlessly transition over to the alternative host without noticeable disruption to the conference attendees.\nZoom was also used to host all live question and answer sessions that followed each pre-recorded conference talk. The host/alternative-host model was not used for Q\u0026amp;A sessions because each hour block contained two conference talks, each with its own Q\u0026amp;A session that required the use of a Zoom license to host. Of course, almost as soon as the conference was finished up, Zoom announced a new feature that would allow meeting attendees to self-select a breakout room of their own choosing to join. This new feature allows for more small group discussions, like our Q\u0026amp;A sessions, to be facilitated by fewer Zoom licenses.\nMailchimp\nMailchimp was used to collect email addresses to add to ALAO\u0026rsquo;s mailing list. Mailchimp integration was simple, clean, and provided a vastly superior sign-up experience in comparison to the sign-up process for ALAO\u0026rsquo;s mailing list via Google Groups. The free tier subscription allowed for a single audience with up to 2,000 contacts. More than enough to support the expected number of sign-ups that we\u0026rsquo;d receive at the annual conference.\nUpTimeRobot\nOnce the conference website was made available to the public, the Website Working Group needed to ensure that the site was available at all times. To alert us of any networking issues, we elected to use the free subscription tier of the website monitoring and notification service - UpTimeRobot.\nUsing UpTimeRobot, we were able to monitor the production and staging environments during the entire development process. Notifications were handled in several ways. First, we built a public dashboard to display the status of ALAO\u0026rsquo;s web properties. Although the dashboard is more of an end user tool - as there is a self-service value in answering the question, \u0026ldquo;Am I the only one having an issue?\u0026rdquo; - the dashboard also collects evidence of historical anomalies that can be used for troubleshooting purposes. Second, we used UpTimeRobot\u0026rsquo;s integration with Slack to alert the Website Working Group of any critical events. These notifications turned out to be very useful when Netlify experienced routing issues, as we were able to immediately contact Netlify support to investigate.\nOne caveat with using the free tier of UpTimeRobot with Netlify deployments, it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to define custom service statuses based upon the HTTP response of a server. After Netlify\u0026rsquo;s password-protection was enabled for the conference website, to restrict access to the conference content to only registered conference attendees, this became a monitoring issue for the production site. Netlify returns a HTTP 401 Unauthorized message when password-protection is enabled and basic authentication is unsuccessful. Since password-protection was enabled for the entire conference site, and UpTimeRobot does not provide a useful method for sending authentication credentials to Netlify in a way that Netlify expects, UpTimeRobot reported the conference site as DOWN for the entire duration that password-protection was enabled. To avoid this next year, exploring the use of a Netlify configuration file, i.e. netlify.toml, to selectively apply password-protection using HTTP headers is advised. Selectively applying password-protection to areas of the conference site with limited-access content will allow an HTTP 200 status to be returned to UpTimeRobot; thus, accurately displaying the status of the website as UP.\nClearlight Communications\nClearlight Communications handles domain registration and DNS zone management for the Academic Library Association of Ohio. Netlify custom domains were created and external DNS was applied using CNAME records for 2020.alaoweb.org and 2020-staging.alaoweb.org. The GitHub repository contained a main branch and a staging branch. Pushes to the main branch would trigger a site build and deployment to https://2020.alaoweb.org, while pushes to the staging branch would rebuild the staging site at the above host. One Netlify feature that the Website Working Group found useful was the \u0026lsquo;deployment preview\u0026rsquo;. Netlify creates a clickable URL to preview changes from any pull requests, so it was easy for any team member to see the proposed changes in a live environment without being required to checkout the branch locally and build the site on localhost.\nSlack\nAs stated earlier in this post, the primary method of communication and interaction among the Website Working Group was Slack, specifically the #conference-website channel. Indispensable was the ability to configure Slack to receive messages from other service providers, as our team made use of the GitHub integration, Netlify integration, and UpTimeRobot integration. Centralizing all of these messages in Slack proved valuable for keeping everyone aware of development activity, engaged in troubleshooting issues, and promptly reviewing all pull requests.\nDisqus\nDisqus is a service that will host blog-style commenting functionality for any web site or online platform. As far as integration into the ALAO conference website is concerned, the main utility of Disqus was to increase engagement with the poster sessions, by providing a real-time comment and response capabilities on each poster. Although limited in its scope, there\u0026rsquo;s a basic subscription tier that\u0026rsquo;s free. The free tier only provides a single audience - from an analytics perspective, a trackable cohort of users - which was fine in our case, as the only intended audience was 2020 conference attendees and we did not intend to use the Disqus service for marketing purposes. For .edu sites and non-profits organizations, Disqus advertising on the free subscription tier is optional; otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s required.\nGoogle Forms\nThe venerable Google Forms was used to collect attendee feedback for each pre-recorded session, as well as obtain survey responses for each of the keynotes, the preconference workshops, and any post-conference reflections.\nAs Google\u0026rsquo;s suite of productivity applications and services (i.e. G Suite) is well-known in Ohio\u0026rsquo;s higher education community, I\u0026rsquo;ll only highlight one feature of note. Google Forms has the ability to pre-fill fields. Using the form\u0026rsquo;s link, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to pass a value into a form field by using a URL parameter. Because we were using Jekyll and Liquid templating, we took advantage of this feature of Google Forms to pre-populate the session title in each of the surveys.\nOne advantage of this method is that it reduces the annoyance of requiring conference attendees to select a session from a long list of conference sessions before responding to any questions. Other benefits of populating the session title include: minimizing the likelihood of human error, increasing the response rate by simplifying the submission process, and providing an overall improved sense of trust in the collected data.\nBelow is a snippet from the site\u0026rsquo;s session modal that builds the href attribute for the Google Form by extracting variables and encoding the session.title and appending it to the site.sessionFeedbackParameter. When a user clicks on the survey button, the session title is pre-filled with the value of session.title.\n{% if session.subtype == 'session' and site.sessionFeedbackForm != null %} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;row survey-row\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;col-md-4\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;col-md-8\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ site.sessionFeedbackForm }}\u0026amp;{{ site.sessionFeedbackParameter }}={{ session.title | url_encode }}\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;survey-button btn\u0026quot; aria-label=\u0026quot;Complete the survey for {{ session.title }}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{session.subtype | capitalize }} Feedback \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {% endif %}  In the site\u0026rsquo;s main configuration file, i.e. config.yml, key:value pairs are used to assign the Google Form URL to sessionFeedbackForm and the parameter name of the form\u0026rsquo;s session title field to sessionFeedbackParameter.\nsessionFeedbackForm: sessionFeedbackParameter: \u0026quot;entry.1153076421\u0026quot;  This solution worked perfectly for us.\nGithub\nMicrosoft-owned GitHub is a hosted software development platform built on top of Git, a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during the development process. The Website Working Group made extensive use of GitHub\u0026rsquo;s features, including: (1) the use of GitHub Teams to manage repository permissions, (2) issue creation for feature enhancement, bug fixes, and the assignment of responsibilities, and (3) to set our meeting agendas with the built-in wiki functionality. Overall, project management was handled almost exclusively through Github’s native tool set.\nYouTube\nYouTube was used to stream all pre-recorded content for the conference.\nYouTube\u0026rsquo;s built-in studio tools automated the process of creating an initial set video captions for human review and editing, reducing the workload for our contributors and speeding up the process to reach a finished product. Ideally, all videos would be uploaded using a set of shared standards. However, we opted to make the process simple for our contributors. We relied on YouTube\u0026rsquo;s desire for consuming video content. Any video file that could be successfully uploaded to YouTube was permitted, even if this produced some discontinuity and fluctuations in video quality.\nYouTube offers there statuses for an uploaded video: public, unlisted, private. Public videos are searchable and can be viewed by anyone. Unlisted videos can be viewed by anyone with a link to the video. Private videos must be selectively shared with individuals to be viewed. All conference videos were set as unlisted. This allowed the conference videos to reside on our YouTube account, but undiscoverable to a wider audience, while affording the Website Working Group the ability to write the video identifier directly into our source code. Each session modal contained an embedded YouTube player to watch the pre-recorded session video.\nNetlify\nProduction and staging deployments of the 2020 conference website were handled by Netlify. While it would have been possible to use GitHub Pages for the site - in fact, early builds were hosted on GitHub Pages - Netlify provided several advantages for our team. While both could handle automated builds directly from push events to our GitHub repository, only Netlify offered site previews for every push. Preview notifications were sent to our Slack channel as a clickable URL, allowing anyone on the team to view the proposed code changes. This encouraged rapid feedback from less technical members of the Website Working Group and encouraged participation throughout the entire development process.\nAs the project code was released under an MIT license, ALAO was able to petition Netlify to sponsor us as an open source project. Netlify\u0026rsquo;s generous support allowed us to use features within their Pro tier without any additional costs to the organization. We used: (1) Basic authentication to password-protect the site, allowing us to restrict access to only registered conference attendees, (2) Slack deployment notifications, and (3) granted everyone on the team access to our Netlify account, excellent for instant rollbacks to any previous version of the site, in the event of a problematic deployment. Open source sponsorship also granted 400GB/month bandwidth and 1000 build minutes/month, more resources than we would need to host a successful conference.\nIn Closing We had a lot of fun with our code releases, as the guidelines for release names show.\n Release names will follow an alphabetical nomenclature, similar to the World Meteorological Organization\u0026rsquo;s naming conventions for tropical cyclones. Rather than using gendered names like the WMO, each ALAO release will be named after a spice or herb. The first alpha release being \u0026lsquo;Anise\u0026rsquo;, representing the letter \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo;. If there are more releases in a given year than there are letters in the Latin alphabet, release names should cycle back to the beginning of the Latin alphabet, doubling the letter for the release name (i.e. AA), and follow the rhythmic naming conventions of Ubuntu releases (e.g. \u0026lsquo;Athenian Anise\u0026rsquo;).\n I released v1.0.2 of the site on October 17th, 2020; named, Dandelion. And with that, my time was up. Let the seeds fall where they may.\n","date":1603882800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603882800,"objectID":"8f9556ec5193aa8ce0b846224c8a1502","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2020alao/","publishdate":"2020-10-28T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020alao/","section":"post","summary":"Tools \u0026 Services for a virtual conference","tags":["conferences","ALAO"],"title":"2020... the year of the great learning","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Intro After the success of TEDSIG|2020, TEDSIG membership was invited to participate in a speculative design reading group. Lead by Renee Albrecht-Mallinger - a design strategist, storyteller, educator, and futurist useing human-centered design methods to address problems of all sizes - and John Jung - a computer programmer and design methods workshop facilitator, the \u0026ldquo;Design After the End of the World: Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group\u0026rdquo; was opened for registration. In partnership with LATITUDE, a nonprofit community digital lab in Chicago, the 10 person reading group meet each Thursday, from 6:30-8:30pm CT, between September 3rd and October 22nd to discuss the weekly readings.\nSyllabus As an introduction to the breadth of speculative design, the reading group investigated: the work of Superflux, read selections from Amitav Ghosh\u0026rsquo;s The Great Derangement and Stewart Brand\u0026rsquo;s The Clock of the Long Now: Time and Responsibility​, explored games as a method for idea generation and rapid prototyping, and shared our interpretations and analysis each week.\nFeel free to review an archive of the syllabus.\nNext Steps Beginning with TEDSIG 2020 in July, and continued through an inspired Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group with LATITUDE, the culmination of this yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries was formulated into a call for proposals.\n Speculative Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries\n \u0026ldquo;Futures are not a destination, but a medium for imaginative thought\u0026rdquo; - Anthony Dunne \u0026amp; Fiona Raby\n We might consider post-pandemic libraries to be behind us, or immediately facing us; or, perhaps they\u0026rsquo;re far beyond any near-term horizon. Remote, distant, or extending through centuries into a yet-unimagined future. \u0026lsquo;Post-pandemic\u0026rsquo; is an intentionally nebulous frame of reference, affording almost instantaneous, molecular futures, while simultaneously opening a fissure in contemporary reality: an opportunity for the as-of-yet-unthought-of to be released unto the world.\nAttribution: Joseph Voros\nThis call for proposals seeks submissions for a web-based publication. The finished product will be similar to walking through a curated exhibit at an art gallery, where each contribution stands on its own as a work of art, but together, create an object for reflecting upon our present-day library and information practices.\nWe welcome proposals from underrepresented groups, including but not limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQ+, ability/disability, and non-binary gender identities. We also invite proposals from members of underrepresented and/or marginalized groups that don\u0026rsquo;t fit into the categories listed above.\nPotential contributions might include:\n Photoessays Drawings/sketches Film/trailer Cautionary tales Software/code Object from the future Postcards that travel back in time to us Maps or other fictional cartography Architectural designs Dataset from the future Short stories, theatrical spaces, movements A manifesto Description of an activist event/protest from the future News of a cataclysmic event that serves as a tipping point Reading lists for yet-to-be-written works   Proposals will be accepted until December 7, 2020 and the finished exhibition is slated to be published in late March, 2021.\n","date":1603364400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603364400,"objectID":"1ddb1c548743662c85b9b0a9a2ca502d","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/latitude_reading_group/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/latitude_reading_group/","section":"post","summary":"Speculative Design \u0026 Climate Change","tags":["speculative"],"title":"Design After the End of the World","type":"post"},{"authors":["Derek Zoladz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594771200,"objectID":"07d38017320ed9ef33a4c1f187a35f9e","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/publication/contextualizing_ezproxy/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/contextualizing_ezproxy/","section":"publication","summary":"Contextualizing EZproxy is a presentation to the OhioLINK membership, primarily Ohio's academic libraries.

The interest group’s name and scope was changed in June 2007 to Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group (TEDSIG) to better reflect the evolving status of the group’s constituents in traditional and emerging technologies. By the time that I began working at Columbus State Community College in 2008, it was evidently clear that the traditional role of technical service librarians was on the decline. As a new professional with a bias towards the use of technology in day-to-day library practices, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand why - or how - the technological aspects of the profession were\u0026hellip; on the way out?\nOne of the main co-chair responsibilities is to organize an annual event for members of the TEDSIG community. It\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to contribute to both the growth, and the future direction, of the group. Pondering the overwhelming emptiness of \u0026lsquo;what to do\u0026rsquo; with this tabla rasa, I explored the confusion of my early experiences of technical work in libraries. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that technological work in libraries was on the way out, it was that a specific way of conducting that technical work was on the way out. As I\u0026rsquo;m joining the ranks of the mid-career professionals, this gave me pause. As members of Ohio\u0026rsquo;s TEDSIG community, are we actively designing a future for the next generation of library professionals to step into?\nTo help us explore the design implications of our current and potential library futures, John Jung was invited to speak at TEDSIG 2020.\nJohn Jung is Design Consultant at johnjung.us and Programmer/Analyst at The University of Chicago. John is interested in the different ways that research and design might intersect. He has recently spoken on Speculative Design \u0026amp; Strategy at the Symposium on the Future of Libraries in Seattle, Washington, as well as having lead the provocatively-titled reading group \u0026ldquo;Design After the End of the World\u0026rdquo; in his hometown of Chicago. He has a degree in art from Governors State University and a degree in design methods from the IIT Institute of Design.\n   Speculative and Critical Design and Libraries\nThomas Moynihan once noted: \u0026ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future\u0026rdquo;. If nothing else, this statement gives us pause. Just enough of a delay to remove us from immediacy. Allowing us to bring our set of expectations and assumptions to the foreground and reflect upon how these projections of a near-term reality guide our decision-making in the present. As many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, the struggle is real. To avoid a future that merely recapitulates - both the positive and negative aspects of - our present solutions, we need to think critically about the design of our future. But maybe more so, we need a toolkit to problematize our present. To shake loose our assumptions, and provide just enough distance to consider alternatives.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where Speculative Design is useful. Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being. If it is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward, speculative design has promise as a way to allow us to problematize our present, so as not to repeat our past, by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality.\n ","date":1594684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594684800,"objectID":"1323744bc9ec2749649ee5b29be9b93b","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tedsig2020/","section":"project","summary":"Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being.","tags":["technology","TEDSIG","ALAO"],"title":"Speculative Design \u0026 Libraries","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Lots of Firsts at Code{4}lib 2020 Code{4}lib is the only major conference that I\u0026rsquo;ve attend with a single track. Most conferences are multi-track. At a multi-track conference, attendees gather for a keynote presentation to kick-off the event. But after that collective experience, everyone develops a self-selected path through simultaneously occurring presentations and activities. At Code{4}lib, all attendees experience the same sequence of sessions, lightning talks, breakouts, and keynotes presentations. There\u0026rsquo;s a definitively stronger sense of community that emerges with a single-track conference. As attendees discuss sessions - through the filters of their own local context and professional focus - a richer understanding of each topic develops.\nThis conference also marks the first time that I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on a committee for a national conference. All of my previous conference planning experiences have been either at the state, regional, or institutional-level. As a member of the Website Working Group for the 2020 conference, our team focused mainly on content strategy for web properties and improving the overall experience for on-site and remote attendees, speakers, sponsors, and a host of other interested parties that will stumble upon the content in the coming weeks and months. Our team contributed a number of significant improvements to the overall accessibility of the conference website, including: (1) multiple adjustments to the document structure, (2) removing situations of skipped heading to ease screenreader traversal, and whenever possible (3) swapping static content with variable references, so that next year\u0026rsquo;s working group will be able to customize the conference website more fully by simply updating the content in the site\u0026rsquo;s data.yml file.\nAnother first? How about navigating the terrain when your conference coincides with the emergence of the global pandemic: COVID-19. Impossible to anticipate, but major crises highlight the spectrum of financial and logistical realities faced by any organization that hosts a national conference. Hats off to the Local Planning Committee, as they did a spectacular job of keeping on top of CDC recommendations and guiding with definitive leadership. And the Streaming Video Committee, they kept the remote presentations connected and engaged with flawless momentum. Bravo.\nFood, \u0026lsquo;Cause the Answer is Always \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; I ❤️ food. One of the things that I savor about visiting another city - for a conference or otherwise - are those brief moments that I actually get to experience it\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness. When I visited Portland, Oregon several years ago, the food culture was truly exceptional. Portland set a rather high bar for my future gastronomic explorations. But, a treasure can be uncovered anywhere. One pleasant surprise along my conference trek has been Minneapolis, Minnesota. Quite literally, the best breakfast tostada I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten was at Mercury, which is less than a city block from the light rail station at Nicollet Mall.\nUnfortunately, Pittsburgh was slightly underwhelming. I did manage to discover a tasty sandwich shop, Gaucho\u0026rsquo;s Parrilla Argentina  in the Strip District, and the downtown location of Nicky\u0026rsquo;s Thai Kitchen had a refreshing ginger-infused hot sake that was entirely welcome after a full day.\nHotel Oddities A rather large sinkhole exposed the bowels of the city, and swallowed a city bus in October 2019, remained unrepaired in front of the Westin hotel. And the elevator controls were\u0026hellip; um, peculiar. Rather than attempting to describe it myself, I\u0026rsquo;ll just point to the following 5 minute lightening talk that does a much better job than I can:\n Expectations and Conventions: A code{4}lib Elevator Story.  Yes, it really is a fun and informative talk that\u0026rsquo;s worth your next coffee break.\nLots of Projects that I\u0026rsquo;ll Follow-up on: Before heading to the conference, I was already in the process of spinning up the digital asset management system Hyku on a t3-large EC2 instance. Having just finished writing a docker-compose-ohn.yml file to set up an instance of Hyku behind the reverse proxy Traefik and using Portainer as a container management tool, I was just beginning to explore Hyku\u0026rsquo;s possibilities.\nAs such, I stopped by the Samvera community table during one the breaks for a brief chat about the Hyku for Consortia project.\nThe main focus of the Hyku for Consortia work is to implement a series of changes to the permissions of Hyku. While Hyku is architected as a multi-tenant application right out of the box, there is no current method to provide a group of users with the ability to work across tenants. The Hyku for Consortia project aims to create this feature to facilitate cross-consortial collaborations, as well as allowing the development of administrative governance bodies, say \u0026ldquo;a standards and review body\u0026rdquo;, which could provide guidance and assistance throughout all of the tenants hosted on a single Hyku instance. The project has partnered with Notch8 out of San Diego to complete the feature development.\n\u0026hellip; Just a Few Others So many tools, so little time.\nHTTP Toolkit\nIs this a mashup of Wireshark and Fiddler, but more intuitive? We\u0026rsquo;ll find out soon enough :)\nPreserve this Podcast\nLikely of more interest to public libraries, setting up a DIY podcast preservation workshop might appeal to communities with an interest in audio or citizen journalism. Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been much more focused on the applicability of The Carpentries workshops for academic technical services departments\u0026hellip; especially for mid-sized academic libraries located within reasonable geographic proximity to any major metropolitan area. These skills need to be acquired now.\nWagtail\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an open source content management system built on Django. It can be used to create simple apps that can be embedded into link resolvers, or other library platforms, to allow patrons to report missing PDFs, broken links, or other problematic content within a vendor\u0026rsquo;s platform. Input capture mechanisms can be coded using client-side Javascript.\nBrowserStack\nExecute automated browser tests as part of a CI/CD pipeline. There\u0026rsquo;s a free-tier planning for testing open source projects.\nHelium\nAn alternative to Selenium for driving a browser. Useful for application testing and automating routine chores. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to giving this tool a test drive.

At the moment, I\u0026rsquo;m using it as a well-structured notebook to recall quotes and collect ideas of all sorts. With the ability to sync notebooks to both OwnCloud and NextCloud - as well as several other storage solutions - the availability of my notebooks across multiple OSes and environments makes it an application that I\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy on many occasions in 2020+.\nDockstation\nIf you want: (1) a gentle, graphical, introduction to engineering microservice-based applications with Docker Compose, (2) an interface to the container registry of Docker Hub, and (3) the ability to expose your container logs with the click of a button, DockStation is a wonderful gateway into the world of containers. I develop all of my docker-compose.yml files using Dockstation on macOS.\nPi-Hole\nRunning on a raspberry pi 3 on my home LAN, Pi-Hole provides DNS-level ad blocking on the network. I\u0026rsquo;m using Pi-hole as my DHCP server to assign IP addresses to clients on the LAN. Via dnsmasq, Pi-hole is also responsible for resolving a few host names on the LAN for applications like my Koha instance and backup server.\nJekyll\nWhile working with the Code4Lib web team on the 2020 (Pittsburgh, PA) conference website, I\u0026rsquo;ve become acquainted with this ruby-based static site generator. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Hugo for my personal website, as well as for the Consortium of Ohio Libraries website, for roughly 2 years. Hugo has been reliable, but Jekyll as several themes for software project documentation and product marketing that have simple, yet complete, designs. I\u0026rsquo;ll likely explore these themes for other projects in 2020.\nBitwarden\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m currently using LastPass, I\u0026rsquo;ve only begun to evaluate the full potential of BitWarden. I prefer open source applications, but this password management solution falls into the aspirational category for the coming year.\nGitLab\nAccording to the project website, \u0026ldquo;GitLab is a complete DevOps platform\u0026rdquo;. My main reason for creating a GitLab account is to explore the broader range of open source projects, whose primary source code repository might live within the GitLab ecosystem.

As such, I would need to modify the color definitions to suit my personal goals of: (1) being able to easily differentiate between directory content that my current user owns or is a member of the assigned group, (2) rapidly distinguish between files and directories, and (3) generally list common metadata elements that experiencing has shown to be frequently useful in troubleshooting an issue.\nFor the moment, here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m using:\n# ------------------------------ # exa - Color Scheme Definitions # ------------------------------ export EXA_COLORS=\u0026quot;\\ da=38;5;245:\\ di=38;5;14:\\ sn=38;5;28:\\ sb=38;5;28:\\ uu=38;5;40:\\ un=38;5;160:\\ gu=38;5;40:\\ gn=38:5:160:\\ bl=38;5;220:\\ ur=37:\\ uw=37:\\ ux=37:\\ ue=37:\\ gr=37:\\ gw=37:\\ gx=37:\\ tr=37:\\ tw=37:\\ tx=37:\\ su=37:\\ sf=37:\\ xa=37\u0026quot;  exa has a wide range of configurable settings and features. After barely scratching the surface of exa\u0026rsquo;s functionality, I\u0026rsquo;ve configured a tool that lists directory contents in a clear, and highly meaningful way, that fits my workflow. exa\u0026rsquo;s documentation provides adequate description to customize output to fix various use cases. For example, I\u0026rsquo;m not using any of the git integration, extended attributes, or unix-like tree expansion of the file system.\nSo, what am I using? Well\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s spelled out in the ls alias in my .zshrc\nalias ls=\u0026quot;exa --long --header --links --inode --blocks --accessed --modified --created --group --all --sort=.name --group-directories-first\u0026quot;  That\u0026rsquo;s it!\n","date":1565348400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565348400,"objectID":"06d066bafbb60584dbde7f2004dcb9aa","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/exa/","publishdate":"2019-08-09T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/exa/","section":"post","summary":"tl;dr: informative metadata at a glance","tags":["applications"],"title":"Why ls is exa","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Forever, I\u0026rsquo;ve used nano as my command-line text editor. I\u0026rsquo;ve never had an issue with it. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s been so reliable that I\u0026rsquo;ve keep it around much longer than I should have. It still works well for most of my needs, but it\u0026rsquo;s time to expand my suite of skills and learn something new.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m switching to vim.\nOut-of-the-box, vim is a tabula rasa, a blank slate, and it feels oddly empty. To fill this vacuum, my first step in making the transition was to explore plugin managers. Of course, this is following an introductory period to learn the basics. If I was going to successfully make the switch, I was going to need to first personalize my instance vim.\nI selected Tim Pope\u0026rsquo;s pathogen.vim as my plugin manager. pathogen.vim allows for each plugin to be placed into its own version-controlled directory and loaded at runtime. Installing a plugin is straightforward: git clone into ~/.vim/bundle/. Simple, maintainable, elegant.\nHere are a few of the plugins that comprise my base:\n jellybeans.vim: Because everyone needs a cheerful, dark-mode enabled, color scheme. nerdtree.vim: If you\u0026rsquo;re going to be using vim for any amount of time, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to have a file explorer. fugitive.vim: A way more advanced git wrapper than I currently need, but a rich avenue for exploration and growth. I\u0026rsquo;m basically using this plugin to display git information in the 'statusline' via\u0026hellip; lightline.vim: In a nutshell, an easy to use and highly configurable 'statusline' plugin.

Now that we have that out of the way, here are a few of the apps that I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered over the last 365 days that I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking with me into 2019.\nPyCharm\nPyCharm is a Python IDE with an extensive collection of plugins. I\u0026rsquo;m using the community edition to develop Python scripts in support the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, mainly to interact with the Evergreen ILS. PyCharm includes a useful testing suite and refactoring tools, while also providing straightforward integration with GitHub and seamless implementation of pipenv virtual environments. Simple on-boarding for new python developers, but feature rich and extensible as your needs grow.\niTerm2\nEssentially, a terminal replacement for the native terminal application that shipped with my MacBook Pro. I find the ability to split terminal panes both vertically and horizontally an advantage for different tasks. I\u0026rsquo;ve also made use of the integrated search feature quite a bit. With colorized output, it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful to use. There are also a slew of other powerful features that I rarely make use of (in 2018, at least).\nSequel Pro\nA MacOS native application for interacting with MySQL and MariaDB and a replacement phpMyAdmin. Enough said.\nDB browser for SQLite\nOpen source application to create and edit SQLite database files. My main use case is to import Excel worksheets and be able to execute SQL commands on the data. Maybe more importantly is the ability to import multiple Excel worksheets, join them together, and query across them. This tool said me quite a bit of time when working with the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) this past year.\nBrave\nA web browser built on Chromium and the Blink rendering engine, a fork of WebKit. It\u0026rsquo;s my drop-in replacement for Google Chrome at the moment.\nOh My Zsh\nI\u0026rsquo;ve abandoned Bash and began using the Z shell on my MacBook Pro. I\u0026rsquo;m a very big fan of the available themes, which have assisted with git workflow and generally made working in the terminal a much more pleasant and enjoyable experience. Highly recommended.\nPySip2\nA Python-based SIP 2 client that has been invaluable this year. I\u0026rsquo;ve used this tool for testing SIP connectivity during the statewide implementation of Lynda.com, while establishing authentication for the Ohio Digital Library, for new subscriptions to Hoopla, and also while implementing a PC management system at one on the COOL libraries.

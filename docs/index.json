Zoladz","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The previous year has brought an increased focus on the Python programming language. In particular, web frameworks and libraries using to facilitate full-stack application development. My day-to-day activities at OPLIN (Ohio Public Library Information Network) involve the creation, maintenance, and implementation of new features for a suite of custom applications that enable OPLIN’s internal workflows and processes in support of Ohio’s 251 public libraries. Here’s a set of applications that I’m excited to take with me into the new year.\nFastAPI FastAPI is a Python web framework for creating enterprise-grade, production-ready APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). FastAPI builds upon Starlette, a powerful toolkit for engineering asynchronous web services in Python. FastAPI has an amazing set of out-of-the-box features including: (1) inbound and outbound data validation, (2) authentication support for OAuth2, JSON web tokens, and basic auth, and (3) a robust middleware and dependency injection system for extending built-in services or easing the integration path for alternatives.\nUvicorn, a low-level ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server loads and serves a FastAPI application. Uvicorn’s live reloading feature is useful for viewing code changes quickly during development; but for production apps, you’ll want to add Gunicorn as a Uvicorn process manager to ensure a healthy state of worker processes to handle web requests destined for your FastAPI application.\nInteractive API documentation is also automatically generated by FastAPI, using either Swagger UI or ReDoc as the output format. In a nutshell, it’s an amazing framework for rapidly prototyping a demo and/or designing an enterprise-grade API applications.\nSwagger UI [documentation] Pydantic The inbound and outbound data validation features of FastAPI are provided by Pydantic, a validation and serialization library for Python built on Rust. Pydantic takes advantage of Python’s native type hints and dataclasses to facilitate its magic, which includes type coercion of untrusted data by default. Pydantic models are standard Python classes that inherit from Pydantic’s BaseModel. Define a model, pass it some untrusted data, and “Pydantic guarantees that the fields of the resultant model will conform to the field types defined on the model”.\nAdhering to JSON Schema standards; thus, enabling the auto-generation of OpenAPI Specification 3.x compliant documentation, Pydantic models are self-documenting. Because of their strict implementation and adherence to standards, Pydantic models can be generated from a wide variety of originating sources by building the necessary translation layer from a solid and well-defined foundation.\nSQLAlchemy SQLAlchemy is a enterprise-grade, high performance toolkit for working with relational databases using either native Python or direct SQL statements. After working with the Evergreen ILS system for several years, I’ve been using Postgres as my preferred relational database for almost any task. I’m also using the latest version of Psycopg as my Postgres adaptor. Psycopg wraps libpq and fully-implements PEP 249. It suits my needs quite well, but I’m open to trying alternatives.\nCore and ORM (Object Relational Mapper) Engine and Connection Architecture [documentation] SQLAlchemy has two components: Core and ORM.\nCore provides the resources for defining the dialect of the underlying database and creating a connection to execute database transactions. SQLAlchemy’s engine object, a component of core, provides the fundamental methods for establishing a database connection. The engine provides low-level statement execution and can be used to talk directly to the database via SQL statements.\nCore also has a system for listening to common database events and triggering arbitrary code in response. This system allows for the programmatic execution of tasks like attaching triggers after table creation, loading test data on application startup, or anything you can dream up. It’s phenomenally flexible.\nORM (Object Relational Mapper) provides a method of working with relational databases using native Python data structures. The ORM is a essentially a translation layer between the data representation used by a database and those used in object-oriented programming like Python. SQLAlchemy’s ORM enables the amazing ability to code a single Python class, known as a Declarative Mapping, that simultaneously defines both the Python object model and the metadata that describes a real SQL table in a Postgres database.\nBelow is an illustrative example of a declarative mapping of a User object:\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base Base: declarative_base() class User(Base): __tablename__: \u0026#34;user_account\u0026#34; id: Mapped[int]: mapped_column(primary_key=True, index=True) first_name[str]: mapped_column(String(50)) last_name[str]: mapped_column(String(50)) fullname: column_property(f\u0026#39;{firstname} {lastname}\u0026#39;) address: Mapped[\u0026#39;Address\u0026#39;]: …","date":1703329200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703329200,"objectID":"4f8b14dcaafb09c85509b3fc2ea6672f","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2024apps/","publishdate":"2023-12-23T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2024apps/","section":"post","summary":"A short list of applications that I've found useful in 2023.","tags":["applications"],"title":"Apps I'm Taking into 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"While it’s a major challenge to identify all of the scripts, command line tools, and web-based applications that have influenced my thoughts and workflow over the previous year, here’s a set of applications that I’m excited to take with me into the new year.\nD2 Visual expressions are a regular and important part of the documentation process. I organize my thoughts and presentations with diagrams, so it’s not surprising that I’ve discovered another tool to add to my arsenal. Last year, it was mermaind.js. For this coming year, I’ll be exploring D2.\nD2 is a declarative, diagramming language. In the simplest terms, you describe the end state of a diagram in text, while D2 renders the textual definitions into a image of the diagram.\nDiagram Rendered by D2 [documentation] Koodo Reader Koodo Reader is a cross-platform, open source reader for a variety of common ebook formats and document types. Binaries are available for Windows, macOS, and all Linux distributions. There’s also a a web-based implementation, if you prefer to run the reader on localhost. I’ve been using this application for several months now. Although there are a few quirks at times with the reflowing to text, the ability to easily access documentation in a book-like manner has been quite fun.\nFormat support:\nEPUB (.epub) Scanned document (.pdf, .djvu) DRM-free Mobipocket (.mobi) and Kindle (.azw3) Plain text (.txt) FictionBook (.fb2) Comic book archive (.cbr, .cbz, .cbt) Rich text (.md, .docx, .rtf) Hyper Text (.html, .xml, .xhtml, .htm) Koodo Reader Interface [documentation] If you’re on macOS and using Brew as your package manager, installation couldn’t be simpler.\nbrew install --cask koodo-reader Gitea For the better part of the last six year, I’ve contributed the majority of my code to public and private repositories on Microsoft’s GitHub platform. Starting with my employment at the Ohio Public Library Information Network, I’ll be contributing a lot more of my code to our internal Gitea instance.\nPerhaps you’ve spotted a trend of using open source solutions, whenever possible. Gitea is no different. Gitea is an open source, git-based version control system. At OPLIN, we self-host a number of applications that faciliate our daily work, monitor our services to Ohio’s public libraries, and maintain our internal knowledge base and business processes. While Gitea lacks some of the out-of-the-box features I’m familiar with on GitHub, those missing features were value-add rather than mission critical. The improved securty of our internal applications are well worth these minimal tradeoffs.\nMetatext With the implosion of the bird-site at the end of 2022, I’m moving to a “Mastodon first” approach. Metatext is the iPhone app that I’m using to interact with the fediverse. It’s a free, open source Mastodon client. With the rapid, exponential growth of Mastodon’s community over the last few weeks, Metatext is looking for new maintainers to ensure the viability of an open source iOS client into the future.\nCare to connect? You can find me on the extremely small Code4Lib instance at @derekz@code4lib.social.\nVS Code During my tenure at OhioNet, I was exclusively working with PyCharm as my integrated development environment. PyCharm is a complete solution for Python development. IntelliJ’s philosophy is along the lines of, “Here are the best in class tools, go forth”. Launch the application and you’re ready to write code.\nVisual Studio Code is more of a “Roll your Own” solution. Out-of-the-box, it’s a blank slate that you customize through extensions. The difficulty is not the availability of customization options. There are a plethora of extensions in the marketplace. The challenge is finding the robust and lightweight set of extensions that possess the features that you require, without too much in the way of creating a time-consuming administrative nightmare.\nHere are a few extentions I’m using:\nSQLTools VS Code Python Python Indent Indent Rainbow CSV Rainbow Visual Studio Code IDE [website] ","date":1671793200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671793200,"objectID":"f7d4081923ebbb1913c4a11a04ee58de","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2023apps/","publishdate":"2022-12-23T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023apps/","section":"post","summary":"A short list of applications that I've found useful in 2022.","tags":["applications"],"title":"Apps I'm Taking into 2023","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After six years at OhioNet, I\u0026#39;m thrilled to announce that I\u0026#39;ve accepted a position as Software Developer at the Ohio Public Library Information Network.

Fatigued, dirty, and weary from their labor, a familiar sense of exhaustion that arrives towards the end of the work week. For an instant, it’s real. And then, without hesitation, it becomes hallucinatory. All too quickly, you regain your wits and realize it’s a simulation. A gift. A hyperreal sculpture from the artist, Duane Hanson.\nThat instant, from hallucination to realization, perfectly describes the speed of the previous two years. Time feels impossibly condensed, dehydrated, motionless… and yet, somehow, more thoroughly exhausting. As if the unfolding of the last two years occurred while trying to determine the nature of the figure in the foreground.

It was a late October afternoon – at an oddly remote conference center in Wilmington, Ohio. I was listening to a presentation from John Jung and Kathy Zadrozny, both from the University of Chicago, about the use of design fiction – specifically, the creation of believable near-future stories to explore the social, cultural and ethical aspects of technological change. The year was 2016 and this presentation made a deep and lasting impression on me.\n©2021 OpenStreetMap Contributors | ODbL 1.0 license Fast-forward to 2018, when I became co-chair of TEDSIG in July. Taking the interest group in a fresh direction was an intentional decision. Rather than continue to facilitate workshops and schedule learning opportunities that focused on the day-to-day tooling that enables library-specific technical work, I wanted to use this opportunity to reinvigorate our group by reflecting on first principles and foundations. Accepting that many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness served as a premise to encourage us to consider alternative futures. However, to avoid a future that merely recapitulates both the positive and negative aspects of our present solutions, we needed to think critically about the design of our future.\nTEDSIG 2020 invited John Jung to present an hour-long exploration of Speculative/Critical Design and Libraries. Speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being, where traditional design attempts to solve problems. Speculative design holds promise for libraries as a way to problematize our present by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality. Thomas Moynihan: “We perceive the world as anticipations of its future”. It is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward.\n“We perceive the world as anticipations of its future”\nAttendees of TEDSIG 2020 were invited to continue the exploration by participating in an 8-week speculative design and climate reading group co-facilitated by Renee Albrecht-Mallinger and John Jung. Beginning in September 2020, Design After the End of the World was hosted by the artist community space LATITUDE | Chicago. The outcome of this group’s work resulted in the call for proposals for a Speculative Library Futures web-based publication, of which the resulting contributions are included above.\n","date":1615766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615766400,"objectID":"798be37cc9e4c3391650f30751f868e3","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig_futures/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tedsig_futures/","section":"project","summary":"A yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries by TEDSIG","tags":["technology","TEDSIG","ALAO","career"],"title":"Speculative Library Futures","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"While it’s a major challenge to identify all of the scripts, command line tools, and web-based applications that have influenced my thoughts and workflow over the previous year, here’s a set of applications that I’m excited to take with me into the new year.\nWax Using minimal computing principles, Wax is a project that aims to facilitate the creation of digital exhibits using static site technologies.

Conferences with pricey registration fees or cost-prohibitive for travel reasons have become real opportunities, as library and library-adjacent conferences and workshops transition to online delivery. I’ve registered for three times as many conference as I would in a typical year, but I’ve also not attended most of those events. When the event actually gets here, there’s always other work that I find a better use my time. I guess that’s a consequence of free registration - although I’m not sure how it has been possible for so many organizations to offer free registration for their online events this year. There are plenty of tangible costs associated with a delivery of a fully online conference. Anyway… that’s all a divergence from the intent of this post, which is to reflect upon my work for the 2020 ALAO Conference\nAs the great learning of 2020 continues to bloom, a second upside has been the number of opportunities that have been granted to me to put the complete spectrum of my technical abilities into practice. While unexpected, serving as the Chair of the Website Working Group and Technical Lead for the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) annual conference - ALAO’s first ever fully online conference - has been a highlight for me.\nLeading the Website Working Group was a wonderful opportunity to:\n[1] expand the technical capacity and web property portfolio of ALAO [2] establish a GitHub organization to warehouse and share useful scripts and application code between ALAO members [3] obtain a non-profit Slack account for the organization, with additional features and increased limits and, [4] apply for an open source project account with Netlify to host application deployments for the 2020 conference website. Volunteer projects like this one always provide an opportunity to exercise and develop my leadership abilities, mentor younger colleagues, and further enrich and solidify my project management capabilities.\nTeam Members of the 2020 Website Working Group are as follows:\nDavid W. Green (State Library of Ohio) Melissa Hill (Ohio Wesleyan University) Ken Irwin (Miami University) Ryan Scott (Columbus State Community College) Zach Walton (The Ohio State University) The Website Working Group was responsible for applying the overall conference theme to the website, while adding features and functionality to the source code as gaps were discovered or a new set of needs arose. One of our stated goals was to make the site more plug-and-play for next year’s teams. We did this by replacing any hardcoded values throughout the source code with a centrally-located set of variables. In fact, the majority of variables controlling the website’s behavior and internal logic are contained in a single file at this point. Ideally, this will result in vastly reduced development times for next year’s conference website.\nOver the course of building the website, our primary method of communication was the #conference-website channel of the ALAO Slack workspace. Idea exchange, quick triage, and fast feedback were a breeze via Slack. Complex troubleshooting and issues requiring more in-depth discussion were held at our regularly scheduled meeting. Project management was mainly facilitated through Github’s native tooling, via issue creation, issue assignment of responsibilities, and a wiki for setting the agenda for our regular meetings.\nOur team worked in 3-week sprints over the course of a few months to bring the conference site together. Each sprint would begin with an hour-long meeting to review our progress, discuss any open issues, and set goals and priorities for the next sprint. Since our team was a combination of experienced developers and some folks who were entirely new to static site generators and source code versioning tools, the 3-week pace worked out surprisingly well for the whole team. For the less experienced members of the team, there was enough cushion to begin to explore the source code, generate a list of initial questions, and pursue self-guided learning to get up-to-speed… while keeping just enough momentum under the project for the more experienced team members to maintain interest and continue to drive the project forward. Unfortunately, there are far too few hands-on mentorship opportunities for librarians to build a rich depth of technical knowledge that rivals the expertise of information technology staff. For the members of the Website Working Group, the experience of sharing knowledge and hard skills during the development of the conference website will slowly manifest in the comprehensiveness and degree of digital projects at each team member’s local institution.\nIt’s worth noting that I underestimated the time commitment required to complete this project by roughly 30 hours. I anticipated 60 hours, but the actual time was closer to 90 hours.

In partnership with LATITUDE, a nonprofit community digital lab in Chicago, the 10 person reading group meet each Thursday, from 6:30-8:30pm CT, between September 3rd and October 22nd to discuss the weekly readings.\nSyllabus As an introduction to the breadth of speculative design, the reading group investigated: the work of Superflux, read selections from Amitav Ghosh’s The Great Derangement and Stewart Brand’s The Clock of the Long Now: Time and Responsibility​, explored games as a method for idea generation and rapid prototyping, and shared our interpretations and analysis each week.\nFeel free to review an archive of the syllabus.\nNext Steps Beginning with TEDSIG 2020 in July, and continued through an inspired Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group with LATITUDE, the culmination of this yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries was formulated into a call for proposals.\nSpeculative Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries\n“Futures are not a destination, but a medium for imaginative thought” - Anthony Dunne \u0026amp; Fiona Raby\nWe might consider post-pandemic libraries to be behind us, or immediately facing us; or, perhaps they’re far beyond any near-term horizon. Remote, distant, or extending through centuries into a yet-unimagined future. ‘Post-pandemic’ is an intentionally nebulous frame of reference, affording almost instantaneous, molecular futures, while simultaneously opening a fissure in contemporary reality: an opportunity for the as-of-yet-unthought-of to be released unto the world.\nAttribution: Joseph Voros\nThis call for proposals seeks submissions for a web-based publication.

The interest group’s name and scope was changed in June 2007 to Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group (TEDSIG) to better reflect the evolving status of the group’s constituents in traditional and emerging technologies. By the time that I began working at Columbus State Community College in 2008, it was evidently clear that the traditional role of technical service librarians was on the decline. As a new professional with a bias towards the use of technology in day-to-day library practices, I couldn’t understand why - or how - the technological aspects of the profession were… on the way out?\nOne of the main co-chair responsibilities is to organize an annual event for members of the TEDSIG community. It’s an opportunity to contribute to both the growth, and the future direction, of the group. Pondering the overwhelming emptiness of ‘what to do’ with this tabla rasa, I explored the confusion of my early experiences of technical work in libraries. It wasn’t that technological work in libraries was on the way out, it was that a specific way of conducting that technical work was on the way out. As I’m joining the ranks of the mid-career professionals, this gave me pause. As members of Ohio’s TEDSIG community, are we actively designing a future for the next generation of library professionals to step into?\nTo help us explore the design implications of our current and potential library futures, John Jung was invited to speak at TEDSIG 2020.\nJohn Jung is Design Consultant at johnjung.us and Programmer/Analyst at The University of Chicago. John is interested in the different ways that research and design might intersect. He has recently spoken on Speculative Design \u0026amp; Strategy at the Symposium on the Future of Libraries in Seattle, Washington, as well as having lead the provocatively-titled reading group “Design After the End of the World” in his hometown of Chicago. He has a degree in art from Governors State University and a degree in design methods from the IIT Institute of Design.\nSpeculative and Critical Design and Libraries\nThomas Moynihan once noted: “We perceive the world as anticipations of its future”. If nothing else, this statement gives us pause. Just enough of a delay to remove us from immediacy. Allowing us to bring our set of expectations and assumptions to the foreground and reflect upon how these projections of a near-term reality guide our decision-making in the present. As many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, the struggle is real. To avoid a future that merely recapitulates - both the positive and negative aspects of - our present solutions, we need to think critically about the design of our future. But maybe more so, we need a toolkit to problematize our present. To shake loose our assumptions, and provide just enough distance to consider alternatives.\nThat’s where Speculative Design is useful. Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being. If it is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward, speculative design has promise as a way to allow us to problematize our present, so as not to repeat our past, by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality.\n","date":1594684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594684800,"objectID":"1323744bc9ec2749649ee5b29be9b93b","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tedsig2020/","section":"project","summary":"Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being.","tags":["technology","TEDSIG","ALAO","career"],"title":"Speculative Design \u0026 Libraries","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lots of Firsts at Code{4}lib 2020 Code{4}lib is the only major conference that I’ve attend with a single track. Most conferences are multi-track. At a multi-track conference, attendees gather for a keynote presentation to kick-off the event. But after that collective experience, everyone develops a self-selected path through simultaneously occurring presentations and activities. At Code{4}lib, all attendees experience the same sequence of sessions, lightning talks, breakouts, and keynotes presentations. There’s a definitively stronger sense of community that emerges with a single-track conference. As attendees discuss sessions - through the filters of their own local context and professional focus - a richer understanding of each topic develops.\nThis conference also marks the first time that I’ve worked on a committee for a national conference. All of my previous conference planning experiences have been either at the state, regional, or institutional-level. As a member of the Website Working Group for the 2020 conference, our team focused mainly on content strategy for web properties and improving the overall experience for on-site and remote attendees, speakers, sponsors, and a host of other interested parties that will stumble upon the content in the coming weeks and months. Our team contributed a number of significant improvements to the overall accessibility of the conference website, including: (1) multiple adjustments to the document structure, (2) removing situations of skipped heading to ease screenreader traversal, and whenever possible (3) swapping static content with variable references, so that next year’s working group will be able to customize the conference website more fully by simply updating the content in the site’s data.yml file.\nAnother first? How about navigating the terrain when your conference coincides with the emergence of the global pandemic: COVID-19. Impossible to anticipate, but major crises highlight the spectrum of financial and logistical realities faced by any organization that hosts a national conference. Hats off to the Local Planning Committee, as they did a spectacular job of keeping on top of CDC recommendations and guiding with definitive leadership. And the Streaming Video Committee, they kept the remote presentations connected and engaged with flawless momentum. Bravo.\nFood, ‘Cause the Answer is Always “Yes” I ❤️ food. One of the things that I savor about visiting another city - for a conference or otherwise - are those brief moments that I actually get to experience it’s uniqueness. When I visited Portland, Oregon several years ago, the food culture was truly exceptional. Portland set a rather high bar for my future gastronomic explorations. But, a treasure can be uncovered anywhere. One pleasant surprise along my conference trek has been Minneapolis, Minnesota. Quite literally, the best breakfast tostada I’ve ever eaten was at Mercury, which is less than a city block from the light rail station at Nicollet Mall.\nUnfortunately, Pittsburgh was slightly underwhelming. I did manage to discover a tasty sandwich shop, Gaucho’s Parrilla Argentina in the Strip District, and the downtown location of Nicky’s Thai Kitchen had a refreshing ginger-infused hot sake that was entirely welcome after a full day.\nHotel Oddities A rather large sinkhole exposed the bowels of the city, and swallowed a city bus in October 2019, remained unrepaired in front of the Westin hotel. Pittsburgh port authority bus projecting upward from a sinkhole in the middle of a downtown street And the elevator controls were… um, peculiar. Rather than attempting to describe it myself, I’ll just point to the following 5 minute lightening talk that does a much better job than I can:\nExpectations and Conventions: A code{4}lib Elevator Story. Yes, it really is a fun and informative talk that’s worth your next coffee break.\nLots of Projects that I’ll Follow-up on: Before heading to the conference, I was already in the process of spinning up the digital asset management system Hyku on a t3-large EC2 instance. Having just finished writing a docker-compose-ohn.yml file to set up an instance of Hyku behind the reverse proxy Traefik and using Portainer as a container management tool, I was just beginning to explore Hyku’s possibilities.\nAs such, I stopped by the Samvera community table during one the breaks for a brief chat about the Hyku for Consortia project.\nHexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo ![Hexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo]({{ “hyku_for_consortia.png” | relURL }} “Hexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo”)\nThe main focus of the Hyku for Consortia work is to implement a series of changes to the permissions of Hyku.

If I was going to successfully make the switch, I was going to need to first personalize my instance vim.\nI selected Tim Pope’s pathogen.vim as my plugin manager. pathogen.vim allows for each plugin to be placed into its own version-controlled directory and loaded at runtime. Installing a plugin is straightforward: git clone into ~/.vim/bundle/. Simple, maintainable, elegant.\nHere are a few of the plugins that comprise my base:\njellybeans.vim: Because everyone needs a cheerful, dark-mode enabled, color scheme. nerdtree.vim: If you’re going to be using vim for any amount of time, you’ll want to have a file explorer. fugitive.vim: A way more advanced git wrapper than I currently need, but a rich avenue for exploration and growth. I’m basically using this plugin to display git information in the \u0026#39;statusline\u0026#39; via… lightline.vim: In a nutshell, an easy to use and highly configurable \u0026#39;statusline\u0026#39; plugin. Feel free to take my initial configuration for a spin!\n","date":1559818800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559818800,"objectID":"330224aa7a49230858569108c57e1f1d","permalink":"https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/farewell_nano/","publishdate":"2019-06-06T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/farewell_nano/","section":"post","summary":"Time to retire the venerable command-line text editor.","tags":["applications"],"title":"Farewell, Nano","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I should probably start off with a bit of a caveat.\nOkay. Now that we have that out of the way, here are a few of the apps that I’ve discovered over the last 365 days that I’ll be taking with me into 2019.\nPyCharm\nPyCharm is a Python IDE with an extensive collection of plugins. I’m using the community edition to develop Python scripts in support the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, mainly to interact with the Evergreen ILS. PyCharm includes a useful testing suite and refactoring tools, while also providing straightforward integration with GitHub and seamless implementation of pipenv virtual environments. Simple on-boarding for new python developers, but feature rich and extensible as your needs grow.\niTerm2\nEssentially, a terminal replacement for the native terminal application that shipped with my MacBook Pro. I find the ability to split terminal panes both vertically and horizontally an advantage for different tasks. I’ve also made use of the integrated search feature quite a bit. With colorized output, it’s beautiful to use. There are also a slew of other powerful features that I rarely make use of (in 2018, at least).\nSequel Pro\nA MacOS native application for interacting with MySQL and MariaDB and a replacement phpMyAdmin. Enough said.\nDB browser for SQLite\nOpen source application to create and edit SQLite database files. My main use case is to import Excel worksheets and be able to execute SQL commands on the data. Maybe more importantly is the ability to import multiple Excel worksheets, join them together, and query across them. This tool said me quite a bit of time when working with the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) this past year.\nBrave\nA web browser built on Chromium and the Blink rendering engine, a fork of WebKit. It’s my drop-in replacement for Google Chrome at the moment.\nOh My Zsh\nI’ve abandoned Bash and began using the Z shell on my MacBook Pro. I’m a very big fan of the available themes, which have assisted with git workflow and generally made working in the terminal a much more pleasant and enjoyable experience. Highly recommended.\nPySip2\nA Python-based SIP 2 client that has been invaluable this year. I’ve used this tool for testing SIP connectivity during the statewide implementation of Lynda.com, while establishing authentication for the Ohio Digital Library, for new subscriptions to Hoopla, and also while implementing a PC management system at one on the COOL libraries.

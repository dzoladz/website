The interest group’s name and scope was changed in June 2007 to Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group (TEDSIG) to better reflect the evolving status of the group’s constituents in traditional and emerging technologies. By the time that I began working at Columbus State Community College in 2008, it was evidently clear that the traditional role of technical service librarians was on the decline. As a new professional with a bias towards the use of technology in day-to-day library practices, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand why - or how - the technological aspects of the profession were\u0026hellip; on the way out?\nOne of the main co-chair responsibilities is to organize an annual event for members of the TEDSIG community. It\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity to contribute to both the growth, and the future direction, of the group. Pondering the overwhelming emptiness of \u0026lsquo;what to do\u0026rsquo; with this tabla rasa, I explored the confusion of my early experiences of technical work in libraries. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that technological work in libraries was on the way out, it was that a specific way of conducting that technical work was on the way out. As I\u0026rsquo;m joining the ranks of the mid-career professionals, this gave me pause. As members of Ohio\u0026rsquo;s TEDSIG community, are we actively designing a future for the next generation of library professionals to step into?\nTo help us explore the design implications of our current and potential library futures, John Jung was invited to speak at TEDSIG 2020.\nJohn Jung is Design Consultant at johnjung.us and Programmer/Analyst at The University of Chicago. John is interested in the different ways that research and design might intersect. He has recently spoken on Speculative Design \u0026amp; Strategy at the Symposium on the Future of Libraries in Seattle, Washington, as well as having lead the provocatively-titled reading group \u0026ldquo;Design After the End of the World\u0026rdquo; in his hometown of Chicago. He has a degree in art from Governors State University and a degree in design methods from the IIT Institute of Design.\n   Speculative and Critical Design and Libraries\nThomas Moynihan once noted: \u0026ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future\u0026rdquo;. If nothing else, this statement gives us pause. Just enough of a delay to remove us from immediacy. Allowing us to bring our set of expectations and assumptions to the foreground and reflect upon how these projections of a near-term reality guide our decision-making in the present. As many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, the struggle is real. To avoid a future that merely recapitulates - both the positive and negative aspects of - our present solutions, we need to think critically about the design of our future. But maybe more so, we need a toolkit to problematize our present. To shake loose our assumptions, and provide just enough distance to consider alternatives.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where Speculative Design is useful. Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being. If it is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward, speculative design has promise as a way to allow us to problematize our present, so as not to repeat our past, by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality.\n ","date":1594684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594684800,"objectID":"1323744bc9ec2749649ee5b29be9b93b","permalink":"/project/tedsig2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tedsig2020/","section":"project","summary":"Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being.","tags":["technology"],"title":"Speculative Design \u0026 Libraries","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Lots of Firsts at Code{4}lib 2020 Code{4}lib is the only major conference that I\u0026rsquo;ve attend with a single track. Most conferences are multi-track. At a multi-track conference, attendees gather for a keynote presentation to kick-off the event. But after that collective experience, everyone develops a self-selected path through simultaneously occurring presentations and activities. At Code{4}lib, all attendees experience the same sequence of sessions, lightning talks, breakouts, and keynotes presentations. There\u0026rsquo;s a definitively stronger sense of community that emerges with a single-track conference. As attendees discuss sessions - through the filters of their own local context and professional focus - a richer understanding of each topic develops.\nThis conference also marks the first time that I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on a committee for a national conference. All of my previous conference planning experiences have been either at the state, regional, or institutional-level. As a member of the Website Working Group for the 2020 conference, our team focused mainly on content strategy for web properties and improving the overall experience for on-site and remote attendees, speakers, sponsors, and a host of other interested parties that will stumble upon the content in the coming weeks and months. Our team contributed a number of significant improvements to the overall accessibility of the conference website, including: (1) multiple adjustments to the document structure, (2) removing situations of skipped heading to ease screenreader traversal, and whenever possible (3) swapping static content with variable references, so that next year\u0026rsquo;s working group will be able to customize the conference website more fully by simply updating the content in the site\u0026rsquo;s data.yml file.\nAnother first? How about navigating the terrain when your conference coincides with the emergence of the global pandemic: COVID-19. Impossible to anticipate, but major crises highlight the spectrum of financial and logistical realities faced by any organization that hosts a national conference. Hats off to the Local Planning Committee, as they did a spectacular job of keeping on top of CDC recommendations and guiding with definitive leadership. And the Streaming Video Committee, they kept the remote presentations connected and engaged with flawless momentum. Bravo.\nFood, \u0026lsquo;Cause the Answer is Always \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; I ❤️ food. One of the things that I savor about visiting another city - for a conference or otherwise - are those brief moments that I actually get to experience it\u0026rsquo;s uniqueness. When I visited Portland, Oregon several years ago, the food culture was truly exceptional. Portland set a rather high bar for my future gastronomic explorations. But, a treasure can be uncovered anywhere. One pleasant surprise along my conference trek has been Minneapolis, Minnesota. Quite literally, the best breakfast tostada I\u0026rsquo;ve ever eaten was at Mercury, which is less than a city block from the light rail station at Nicollet Mall.\nUnfortunately, Pittsburgh was slightly underwhelming. I did manage to discover a tasty sandwich shop, Gaucho\u0026rsquo;s Parrilla Argentina  in the Strip District, and the downtown location of Nicky\u0026rsquo;s Thai Kitchen had a refreshing ginger-infused hot sake that was entirely welcome after a full day.\nHotel Oddities A rather large sinkhole exposed the bowels of the city, and swallowed a city bus in October 2019, remained unrepaired in front of the Westin hotel. And the elevator controls were\u0026hellip; um, peculiar. Rather than attempting to describe it myself, I\u0026rsquo;ll just point to the following 5 minute lightening talk that does a much better job than I can:\n Expectations and Conventions: A code{4}lib Elevator Story.  Yes, it really is a fun and informative talk that\u0026rsquo;s worth your next coffee break.\nLots of Projects that I\u0026rsquo;ll Follow-up on: Before heading to the conference, I was already in the process of spinning up the digital asset management system Hyku on a t3-large EC2 instance. Having just finished writing a docker-compose-ohn.yml file to set up an instance of Hyku behind the reverse proxy Traefik and using Portainer as a container management tool, I was just beginning to explore Hyku\u0026rsquo;s possibilities.\nAs such, I stopped by the Samvera community table during one the breaks for a brief chat about the Hyku for Consortia project.\nThe main focus of the Hyku for Consortia work is to implement a series of changes to the permissions of Hyku. While Hyku is architected as a multi-tenant application right out of the box, there is no current method to provide a group of users with the ability to work across tenants. The Hyku for Consortia project aims to create this feature to facilitate cross-consortial collaborations, as well as allowing the development of administrative governance bodies, say \u0026ldquo;a standards and review body\u0026rdquo;, which could provide guidance and assistance throughout all of the tenants hosted on a single Hyku instance. The project has partnered with Notch8 out of San Diego to complete the feature development.\n\u0026hellip; Just a Few Others So many tools, so little time.\nHTTP Toolkit\nIs this a mashup of Wireshark and Fiddler, but more intuitive? We\u0026rsquo;ll find out soon enough :)\nPreserve this Podcast\nLikely of more interest to public libraries, setting up a DIY podcast preservation workshop might appeal to communities with an interest in audio or citizen journalism. Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been much more focused on the applicability of The Carpentries workshops for academic technical services departments\u0026hellip; especially for mid-sized academic libraries located within reasonable geographic proximity to any major metropolitan area. These skills need to be acquired now.\nWagtail\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an open source content management system built on Django. It can be used to create simple apps that can be embedded into link resolvers, or other library platforms, to allow patrons to report missing PDFs, broken links, or other problematic content within a vendor\u0026rsquo;s platform. Input capture mechanisms can be coded using client-side Javascript.\nBrowserStack\nExecute automated browser tests as part of a CI/CD pipeline. There\u0026rsquo;s a free-tier planning for testing open source projects.\nHelium\nAn alternative to Selenium for driving a browser. Useful for application testing and automating routine chores. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to giving this tool a test drive.

At the moment, I\u0026rsquo;m using it as a well-structured notebook to recall quotes and collect ideas of all sorts. With the ability to sync notebooks to both OwnCloud and NextCloud - as well as several other storage solutions - the availability of my notebooks across multiple OSes and environments makes it an application that I\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy on many occasions in 2020+.\nDockstation\nIf you want: (1) a gentle, graphical, introduction to engineering microservice-based applications with Docker Compose, (2) an interface to the container registry of Docker Hub, and (3) the ability to expose your container logs with the click of a button, DockStation is a wonderful gateway into the world of containers. I develop all of my docker-compose.yml files using Dockstation on macOS.\nPi-Hole\nRunning on a raspberry pi 3 on my home LAN, Pi-Hole provides DNS-level ad blocking on the network. I\u0026rsquo;m using Pi-hole as my DHCP server to assign IP addresses to clients on the LAN. Via dnsmasq, Pi-hole is also responsible for resolving a few host names on the LAN for applications like my Koha instance and backup server.\nJekyll\nWhile working with the Code4Lib web team on the 2020 (Pittsburgh, PA) conference website, I\u0026rsquo;ve become acquainted with this ruby-based static site generator. I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Hugo for my personal website, as well as for the Consortium of Ohio Libraries website, for roughly 2 years. Hugo has been reliable, but Jekyll as several themes for software project documentation and product marketing that have simple, yet complete, designs. I\u0026rsquo;ll likely explore these themes for other projects in 2020.\nBitwarden\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m currently using LastPass, I\u0026rsquo;ve only begun to evaluate the full potential of BitWarden. I prefer open source applications, but this password management solution falls into the aspirational category for the coming year.\nGitLab\nAccording to the project website, \u0026ldquo;GitLab is a complete DevOps platform\u0026rdquo;. My main reason for creating a GitLab account is to explore the broader range of open source projects, whose primary source code repository might live within the GitLab ecosystem. As an example, the Evergreen ILS community writes documentation using Asciidoc. Experiments have begun using Antora for generating Evergreen documentation.

But it\u0026rsquo;s an understatment to say that Evergreen is a massive application.

As such, I would need to modify the color definitions to suit my personal goals of: (1) being able to easily differentiate between directory content that my current user owns or is a member of the assigned group, (2) rapidly distinguish between files and directories, and (3) generally list common metadata elements that experiencing has shown to be frequently useful in troubleshooting an issue.\nFor the moment, here\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m using:\n# ------------------------------ # exa - Color Scheme Definitions # ------------------------------ export EXA_COLORS=\u0026quot;\\ da=38;5;245:\\ di=38;5;14:\\ sn=38;5;28:\\ sb=38;5;28:\\ uu=38;5;40:\\ un=38;5;160:\\ gu=38;5;40:\\ gn=38:5:160:\\ bl=38;5;220:\\ ur=37:\\ uw=37:\\ ux=37:\\ ue=37:\\ gr=37:\\ gw=37:\\ gx=37:\\ tr=37:\\ tw=37:\\ tx=37:\\ su=37:\\ sf=37:\\ xa=37\u0026quot;  exa has a wide range of configurable settings and features.

I\u0026rsquo;m using the community edition to develop Python scripts in support the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, mainly to interact with the Evergreen ILS. PyCharm includes a useful testing suite and refactoring tools, while also providing straightforward integration with GitHub and seamless implementation of pipenv virtual environments. Simple on-boarding for new python developers, but feature rich and extensible as your needs grow.\niTerm2\nEssentially, a terminal replacement for the native terminal application that shipped with my MacBook Pro. I find the ability to split terminal panes both vertically and horizontally an advantage for different tasks. I\u0026rsquo;ve also made use of the integrated search feature quite a bit. With colorized output, it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful to use. There are also a slew of other powerful features that I rarely make use of (in 2018, at least).\nSequel Pro\nA MacOS native application for interacting with MySQL and MariaDB and a replacement phpMyAdmin. Enough said.\nDB browser for SQLite\nOpen source application to create and edit SQLite database files. My main use case is to import Excel worksheets and be able to execute SQL commands on the data. Maybe more importantly is the ability to import multiple Excel worksheets, join them together, and query across them. This tool said me quite a bit of time when working with the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) this past year.\nBrave\nA web browser built on Chromium and the Blink rendering engine, a fork of WebKit. It\u0026rsquo;s my drop-in replacement for Google Chrome at the moment.\nOh My Zsh\nI\u0026rsquo;ve abandoned Bash and began using the Z shell on my MacBook Pro. I\u0026rsquo;m a very big fan of the available themes, which have assisted with git workflow and generally made working in the terminal a much more pleasant and enjoyable experience.

&lt;p&gt;One upside of 2020 has been the expansion of learning opportunities. Conferences with pricey registration fees or cost-prohibitive for travel reasons have become real opportunities, as library and library-adjacent conferences and workshops transition to online delivery. I&amp;rsquo;ve registered for three times as many conference as I would in a typical year, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also not attended most of those events. When the event actually gets here, there&amp;rsquo;s always other work that I find a better use my time. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a consequence of free registration - although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how it has been possible for so many organizations to offer free registration for their online events this year. There are plenty of tangible costs associated with a delivery of a fully online conference. Anyway&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s all a divergence from the intent of this post, which is to reflect upon my work for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://2020.alaoweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2020 ALAO Conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the great learning of 2020 continues to bloom, a second upside has been the number of opportunities that have been granted to me to put the complete spectrum of my technical abilities into practice. While unexpected, serving as the Chair of the Website Working Group and Technical Lead for the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) annual conference - ALAO&amp;rsquo;s first ever fully online conference - has been a highlight for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading the Website Working Group was a wonderful opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[1] expand the technical capacity and web property portfolio of ALAO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[2] establish a GitHub organization to warehouse and share useful scripts and application code between ALAO members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[3] obtain a non-profit Slack account for the organization, with additional features and increased limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and, [4] apply for an open source project account with Netlify to host application deployments for the 2020 conference website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volunteer projects like this one always provide an opportunity to exercise and develop my leadership abilities, mentor younger colleagues, and further enrich and solidify my project management capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;team&#34;&gt;Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the 2020 Website Working Group are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David W. Green (State Library of Ohio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melissa Hill (Ohio Wesleyan University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ken Irwin (Miami University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan Scott (Columbus State Community College)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zach Walton (The Ohio State University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Website Working Group was responsible for applying the overall conference theme to the website, while adding features and functionality to the source code as gaps were discovered or a new set of needs arose. One of our stated goals was to make the site more plug-and-play for next year&amp;rsquo;s teams. We did this by replacing any hardcoded values throughout the source code with a centrally-located set of variables. In fact, the majority of variables controlling the website&amp;rsquo;s behavior and internal logic are contained in a single file at this point. Ideally, this will result in vastly reduced development times for next year&amp;rsquo;s conference website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of building the website, our primary method of communication was the &lt;code&gt;#conference-website&lt;/code&gt; channel of the ALAO Slack workspace. Idea exchange, quick triage, and fast feedback were a breeze via Slack. Complex troubleshooting and issues requiring more in-depth discussion were held at our regularly scheduled meeting. Project management was mainly facilitated through Github’s native tooling, via issue creation, issue assignment of responsibilities, and a wiki for setting the agenda for our regular meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team worked in 3-week sprints over the course of a few months to bring the conference site together. Each sprint would begin with an hour-long meeting to review our progress, discuss any open issues, and set goals and priorities for the next sprint. Since our team was a combination of experienced developers and some folks who were entirely new to static site generators and source code versioning tools, the 3-week pace worked out surprisingly well for the whole team. For the less experienced members of the team, there was enough cushion to begin to explore the source code, generate a list of initial questions, and pursue self-guided learning to get up-to-speed&amp;hellip; while keeping just enough momentum under the project for the more experienced team members to maintain interest and continue to drive the project forward. Unfortunately, there are far too few hands-on mentorship opportunities for librarians to build a rich depth of technical knowledge that rivals the expertise of information technology staff. For the members of the Website Working Group, the experience of sharing knowledge and hard skills during the development of the conference website will slowly manifest in the comprehensiveness and degree of digital projects at each team member&amp;rsquo;s local institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that I underestimated the time commitment required to complete this project by roughly 30 hours. I anticipated 60 hours, but the actual time was closer to 90 hours. Although a considerable portion of the additional time occurred due to adding features and functionality that were not envisioned at the onset of the project, it&amp;rsquo;s a reminder to myself to do a better job controlling the scope of the project or padding my estimates a bit more generously to allow for some expansion as the project matures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in the above output from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/casperdcl/git-fame&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;git fame&lt;/a&gt;, Ken Irwin made significant contributions to the development of 2020 conference website. Ken&amp;rsquo;s expertise helped the team to resolve several difficult challenges along the way, that otherwise, would have resulted in a less-than-ideal compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled that &lt;a href=&#34;https://kenirwin.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ken Irwin&lt;/a&gt; will be the Technical Lead for the ALAO 2021, Website Working Group 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tools-services&#34;&gt;Tools &amp;amp; Services&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many all-inclusive virtual conference platforms that have sprouted up over the previous year or so (&lt;a href=&#34;https://hopin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;hopin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://remo.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Remo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://whova.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Whova&lt;/a&gt; to namecheck a few that immediately come to mind). However, there are a few reasons that you might be inclined to roll-your-own assemblage of services to host a virtual conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First | Minimizing Duplicate Service Costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already purchase several of the needed components to host a virtual conference, why make a redundant purchase? As an example, ALAO has a professional subscription to the association management platform - Wild Apricot. Interacting with Wild Apricot is a familiar experience for ALAO membership, and Wild Apricot has a built-in event registration features, making it an obvious choice for handling conference registrations and payment options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second | Building Capacity and Encouraging Participation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building your organization&amp;rsquo;s overall technical capacity can encourage the expansion of services and opportunities made available to membership. While hard skills take time to develop, knowledge sharing and mentorship of colleagues are immediate, and lasting, benefits for the entire organization. Strengthening the sense of internal community can encourage members to take risks, become leaders, and pursue open positions as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third | Offset Contractual Losses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your organization has a multi-year contract with a venue to hold the annual conference, and COVID-19 requires the cancellation of any face-to-face events for the year, you may still be contractually-obligated to pay a hefty cancellation fee. To minimize organizational losses, &amp;ldquo;Doing it on the cheap&amp;rdquo; may become the motto for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the underpinning of the 2020 ALAO conference website were built upon an &lt;em&gt;abandoned?&lt;/em&gt; project for the 2014 GDG Devfest, i.e. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Project Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;, designing a virtual conference requires a careful selection of technologies and hosted services to be properly configured and skillfully aligned in a parallel direction. When you organization&amp;rsquo;s membership very clearly sees the annual conference as the value of - and primary reason for renewing - their membership, doing it on your own is not a decision to take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key considerations in making the decision to take the DIY approach is whether or not your organization has someone willing and - perhaps most importantly - able to take the lead for the project. The project lead will need to allocate considerable volunteer time, have solid communication and project management fundamentals, and posses an intermediate set of technical skills. Below is a list of the development tools and technologies that were required to develop the 2020 ALAO Conference. [&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alaoweb/2020.alaoweb.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Software Version Control&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are a number of others (i.e. JavaScript, jQuery) peppered in here and there, but the above is a list of the major components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;services&#34;&gt;Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a best effort to list the services that were used to create the 2020 ALAO Conference. Each listed component contains a brief description of how it was used during the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zoom.us&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because of its overall familiarity to Ohio&amp;rsquo;s higher education community, and much-less-so based upon the merits of its feature set and functionality, a decision was made to use Zoom as our streaming platform for the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this decision, the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) already maintained an annual subscription to Zoom. This subscription was used to facilitate monthly board meetings and for one-off use by ALAO&amp;rsquo;s many interest groups. Because there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a need for additional capacity for the organization as a whole, the Website Working Group elected to purchase a separate, temporary, month-to-month subscription to Zoom, which was used exclusively for conference events. Our temporary subscription included two host licenses and two large meeting add-ons, as we anticipated 100+ attendees at the opening keynote, closing keynote, and annual awards ceremony. While we ultimately purchased the temporary subscription for two months, we could have easily reduced the duration to a single month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom was used for all real-time events, including the pre-conference workshop, trivia night, awards, and the opening and closing keynotes. As these real-time sessions were critical components of a successful conference - and we were dependent upon our notoriously unreliable home wifi connections (i.e. those pandemic work-from-home scenarios) - the two Zoom licenses were used in a host/alternative-host model. That way, if the meeting host&amp;rsquo;s cat disconnected the internet connection in the middle of a keynote, the meeting would seamlessly transition over to the alternative host without noticeable disruption to the conference attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoom was also used to host all live question and answer sessions that followed each pre-recorded conference talk. The host/alternative-host model was not used for Q&amp;amp;A sessions because each hour block contained two conference talks, each with its own Q&amp;amp;A session that required the use of a Zoom license to host. Of course, almost as soon as the conference was finished up, Zoom announced a new feature that would allow meeting attendees to self-select a breakout room of their own choosing to join. This new feature allows for more small group discussions, like our Q&amp;amp;A sessions, to be facilitated by fewer Zoom licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mailchimp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mailchimp was used to collect email addresses to add to ALAO&amp;rsquo;s mailing list. Mailchimp integration was simple, clean, and provided a vastly superior sign-up experience in comparison to the sign-up process for ALAO&amp;rsquo;s mailing list via Google Groups. The free tier subscription allowed for a single audience with up to 2,000 contacts. More than enough to support the expected number of sign-ups that we&amp;rsquo;d receive at the annual conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://uptimerobot.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UpTimeRobot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once the conference website was made available to the public, the Website Working Group needed to ensure that the site was available at all times. To alert us of any networking issues, we elected to use the free subscription tier of the website monitoring and notification service - UpTimeRobot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using UpTimeRobot, we were able to monitor the production and staging environments during the entire development process. Notifications were handled in several ways. First, we built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://status.alaoweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;public dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to display the status of ALAO&amp;rsquo;s web properties. Although the dashboard is more of an end user tool - as there is a self-service value in answering the question, &amp;ldquo;Am I the only one having an issue?&amp;rdquo; - the dashboard also collects evidence of historical anomalies that can be used for troubleshooting purposes. Second, we used UpTimeRobot&amp;rsquo;s integration with Slack to alert the Website Working Group of any critical events. These notifications turned out to be very useful when Netlify experienced routing issues, as we were able to immediately contact Netlify support to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat with using the free tier of UpTimeRobot with Netlify deployments, it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to define custom service statuses based upon the HTTP response of a server. After Netlify&amp;rsquo;s password-protection was enabled for the conference website, to restrict access to the conference content to only registered conference attendees, this became a monitoring issue for the production site. Netlify returns a HTTP 401 Unauthorized message when password-protection is enabled and basic authentication is unsuccessful. Since password-protection was enabled for the entire conference site, and UpTimeRobot does not provide a useful method for sending authentication credentials to Netlify in a way that Netlify expects, UpTimeRobot reported the conference site as DOWN for the entire duration that password-protection was enabled. To avoid this next year, exploring the use of a Netlify configuration file, i.e. &lt;code&gt;netlify.toml&lt;/code&gt;, to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/#syntax-for-the-headers-file&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;selectively apply password-protection&lt;/a&gt; using HTTP headers is advised. Selectively applying password-protection to areas of the conference site with limited-access content will allow an HTTP 200 status to be returned to UpTimeRobot; thus, accurately displaying the status of the website as UP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://clearlight.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clearlight Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Clearlight Communications handles domain registration and DNS zone management for the Academic Library Association of Ohio. Netlify custom domains were created and external DNS was applied using CNAME records for &lt;code&gt;2020.alaoweb.org&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;2020-staging.alaoweb.org&lt;/code&gt;. The GitHub repository contained a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch and a &lt;code&gt;staging&lt;/code&gt; branch. Pushes to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch would trigger a site build and deployment to &lt;a href=&#34;https://2020.alaoweb.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://2020.alaoweb.org&lt;/a&gt;, while pushes to the &lt;code&gt;staging&lt;/code&gt; branch would rebuild the staging site at the above host. One Netlify feature that the Website Working Group found useful was the &amp;lsquo;deployment preview&amp;rsquo;. Netlify creates a clickable URL to preview changes from any pull requests, so it was easy for any team member to see the proposed changes in a live environment without being required to checkout the branch locally and build the site on localhost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As stated earlier in this post, the primary method of communication and interaction among the Website Working Group was Slack, specifically the &lt;code&gt;#conference-website&lt;/code&gt; channel. Indispensable was the ability to configure Slack to receive messages from other service providers, as our team made use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://slack.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub integration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/notifications&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Netlify integration&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://uptimerobot.com/integrations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UpTimeRobot integration&lt;/a&gt;. Centralizing all of these messages in Slack proved valuable for keeping everyone aware of development activity, engaged in troubleshooting issues, and promptly reviewing all pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Disqus is a service that will host blog-style commenting functionality for any web site or online platform. As far as integration into the ALAO conference website is concerned, the main utility of Disqus was to increase engagement with the poster sessions, by providing a real-time comment and response capabilities on each poster. Although limited in its scope, there&amp;rsquo;s a basic subscription tier that&amp;rsquo;s free. The free tier only provides a single audience - from an analytics perspective, a trackable cohort of users - which was fine in our case, as the only intended audience was 2020 conference attendees and we did not intend to use the Disqus service for marketing purposes. For &lt;code&gt;.edu&lt;/code&gt; sites and non-profits organizations, Disqus advertising on the free subscription tier is optional; otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/forms&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Forms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The venerable Google Forms was used to collect attendee feedback for each pre-recorded session, as well as obtain survey responses for each of the keynotes, the preconference workshops, and any post-conference reflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Google&amp;rsquo;s suite of productivity applications and services (i.e. G Suite) is well-known in Ohio&amp;rsquo;s higher education community, I&amp;rsquo;ll only highlight one feature of note. Google Forms has the ability to pre-fill fields. Using the form&amp;rsquo;s link, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to pass a value into a form field by using a URL parameter. Because we were using Jekyll and Liquid templating, we took advantage of this feature of Google Forms to pre-populate the session title in each of the surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advantage of this method is that it reduces the annoyance of requiring conference attendees to select a session from a long list of conference sessions before responding to any questions. Other benefits of populating the session title include: minimizing the likelihood of human error, increasing the response rate by simplifying the submission process, and providing an overall improved sense of trust in the collected data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a snippet from the site&amp;rsquo;s session modal that builds the &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the Google Form by extracting variables and encoding the &lt;code&gt;session.title&lt;/code&gt; and appending it to the &lt;code&gt;site.sessionFeedbackParameter&lt;/code&gt;. When a user clicks on the survey button, the session title is pre-filled with the value of &lt;code&gt;session.title&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% if session.subtype == &#39;session&#39; and site.sessionFeedbackForm != null %}
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;row survey-row&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;col-md-4&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;col-md-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;{{ site.sessionFeedbackForm }}&amp;amp;{{ site.sessionFeedbackParameter }}={{ session.title | url_encode }}&amp;quot;
            class=&amp;quot;survey-button btn&amp;quot;
            aria-label=&amp;quot;Complete the survey for {{ session.title }}}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;{{session.subtype | capitalize }}
            Feedback
        &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
{% endif %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the site&amp;rsquo;s main configuration file, i.e. &lt;code&gt;config.yml&lt;/code&gt;, key:value pairs are used to assign the Google Form URL to &lt;code&gt;sessionFeedbackForm&lt;/code&gt; and the parameter name of the form&amp;rsquo;s session title field to &lt;code&gt;sessionFeedbackParameter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sessionFeedbackForm:
sessionFeedbackParameter: &amp;quot;entry.1153076421&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This solution worked perfectly for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Microsoft-owned GitHub is a hosted software development platform built on top of Git, a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during the development process. The Website Working Group made extensive use of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s features, including: (1) the use of GitHub Teams to manage repository permissions, (2) issue creation for feature enhancement, bug fixes, and the assignment of responsibilities, and (3) to set our meeting agendas with the built-in wiki functionality. Overall, project management was handled almost exclusively through Github’s native tool set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
YouTube was used to stream all pre-recorded content for the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube&amp;rsquo;s built-in studio tools automated the process of creating an initial set video captions for human review and editing, reducing the workload for our contributors and speeding up the process to reach a finished product. Ideally, all videos would be uploaded using a set of shared standards. However, we opted to make the process simple for our contributors. We relied on YouTube&amp;rsquo;s desire for consuming video content. Any video file that could be successfully uploaded to YouTube was permitted, even if this produced some discontinuity and fluctuations in video quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YouTube offers there statuses for an uploaded video: public, unlisted, private. Public videos are searchable and can be viewed by anyone. Unlisted videos can be viewed by anyone with a link to the video. Private videos must be selectively shared with individuals to be viewed. All conference videos were set as unlisted. This allowed the conference videos to reside on our YouTube account, but undiscoverable to a wider audience, while affording the Website Working Group the ability to write the video identifier directly into our source code. Each session modal contained an embedded YouTube player to watch the pre-recorded session video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Production and staging deployments of the 2020 conference website were handled by Netlify. While it would have been possible to use GitHub Pages for the site - in fact, early builds were hosted on GitHub Pages - Netlify provided several advantages for our team. While both could handle automated builds directly from push events to our GitHub repository, only Netlify offered site previews for every push. Preview notifications were sent to our Slack channel as a clickable URL, allowing anyone on the team to view the proposed code changes. This encouraged rapid feedback from less technical members of the Website Working Group and encouraged participation throughout the entire development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the project code was released under an MIT license, ALAO was able to petition Netlify to sponsor us as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/legal/open-source-policy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open source project&lt;/a&gt;. Netlify&amp;rsquo;s generous support allowed us to use features within their Pro tier without any additional costs to the organization. We used: (1) Basic authentication to password-protect the site, allowing us to restrict access to only registered conference attendees, (2) Slack deployment notifications, and (3) granted everyone on the team access to our Netlify account, excellent for instant rollbacks to any previous version of the site, in the event of a problematic deployment. Open source sponsorship also granted 400GB/month bandwidth and 1000 build minutes/month, more resources than we would need to host a successful conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;in-closing&#34;&gt;In Closing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a lot of fun with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alaoweb/2020.alaoweb.org/releases&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;code releases&lt;/a&gt;, as the guidelines for release names show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release names will follow an alphabetical nomenclature, similar to the World Meteorological Organization&amp;rsquo;s naming conventions for tropical cyclones. Rather than using gendered names like the WMO, each ALAO release will be named after a spice or herb. The first alpha release being &amp;lsquo;Anise&amp;rsquo;, representing the letter &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo;. If there are more releases in a given year than there are letters in the Latin alphabet, release names should cycle back to the beginning of the Latin alphabet, doubling the letter for the release name (i.e. AA), and follow the rhythmic naming conventions of Ubuntu releases (e.g. &amp;lsquo;Athenian Anise&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I released v1.0.2 of the site on October 17th, 2020; named, &lt;strong&gt;Dandelion&lt;/strong&gt;. And with that, my time was up. Let the seeds fall where they may.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/2HOMy2lC2YoN2/source.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Blowing a dandelion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the success of &lt;a href=&#34;https://tedsig.alaoweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TEDSIG|2020&lt;/a&gt;, TEDSIG membership was invited to participate in a speculative design reading group. Lead by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reneelynn.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Renee Albrecht-Mallinger&lt;/a&gt; - a design strategist, storyteller, educator, and futurist useing human-centered design methods to address problems of all sizes - and &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnjung.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;John Jung&lt;/a&gt; - a computer programmer and design methods workshop facilitator, the &amp;ldquo;Design After the End of the World: Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group&amp;rdquo; was opened for registration. In partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latitudechicago.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LATITUDE&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit community digital lab in Chicago, the 10 person reading group meet each Thursday, from 6:30-8:30pm CT, between September 3rd and October 22nd to discuss the weekly readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;syllabus&#34;&gt;Syllabus&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an introduction to the breadth of speculative design, the reading group investigated: the work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://superflux.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Superflux&lt;/a&gt;, read selections from Amitav Ghosh&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Great Derangement&lt;/em&gt; and Stewart Brand&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Clock of the Long Now: Time and Responsibility​&lt;/em&gt;, explored games as a method for idea generation and rapid prototyping, and shared our interpretations and analysis each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to review an &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzoladz.github.io/2020-reading-group/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;archive of the syllabus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning with TEDSIG 2020 in July, and continued through an inspired Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group with LATITUDE, the culmination of this yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries was formulated into a call for proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://futures.alaoweb.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Speculative Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Futures are not a destination, but a medium for imaginative thought&amp;rdquo; - Anthony Dunne &amp;amp; Fiona Raby&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might consider post-pandemic libraries to be behind us, or immediately facing us; or, perhaps they&amp;rsquo;re far beyond any near-term horizon. Remote, distant, or extending through centuries into a yet-unimagined future. &amp;lsquo;Post-pandemic&amp;rsquo; is an intentionally nebulous frame of reference, affording almost instantaneous, molecular futures, while simultaneously opening a fissure in contemporary reality: an opportunity for the as-of-yet-unthought-of to be released unto the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/dzoladz/tedsig-futures/blob/master/futures_cone.png?raw=true&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;  Attribution: &lt;a href=&#34;https://thevoroscope.com/2017/02/24/the-futures-cone-use-and-history/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Joseph Voros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This call for proposals seeks submissions for a web-based publication. The finished product will be similar to walking through a curated exhibit at an art gallery, where each contribution stands on its own as a work of art, but together, create an object for reflecting upon our present-day library and information practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome proposals from underrepresented groups, including but not limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQ+, ability/disability, and non-binary gender identities. We also invite proposals from members of underrepresented and/or marginalized groups that don&amp;rsquo;t fit into the categories listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential contributions might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photoessays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawings/sketches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Film/trailer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cautionary tales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software/code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object from the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postcards that travel back in time to us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maps or other fictional cartography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectural designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dataset from the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short stories, theatrical spaces, movements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A manifesto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description of an activist event/protest from the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News of a cataclysmic event that serves as a tipping point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading lists for yet-to-be-written works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals will be accepted until &lt;strong&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/strong&gt; and the finished exhibition is slated to be published in late &lt;strong&gt;March, 2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/tedsig2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Co-Chair of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alaoweb.org/igs/tedsig/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group&lt;/a&gt; (TEDSIG) - a community within the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) - my professional experiences have circumvented the shared set of historical struggles that define the group&amp;rsquo;s identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TEDSIG was founded in 1993 as the Technical Services Interest Group (TSIG). The interest group’s name and scope was changed in June 2007 to Technical, Electronic, and Digital Services Interest Group (TEDSIG) to better reflect the evolving status of the group’s constituents in traditional and emerging technologies. By the time that I began working at Columbus State Community College in 2008, it was evidently clear that the traditional role of technical service librarians was on the decline. As a new professional with a bias towards the use of technology in day-to-day library practices, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand why - or how -  the technological aspects of the profession were&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;on the way out&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main co-chair responsibilities is to organize an annual event for members of the TEDSIG community. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to contribute to both the growth, and the future direction, of the group. Pondering the overwhelming emptiness of &amp;lsquo;what to do&amp;rsquo; with this tabla rasa, I explored the confusion of my early experiences of technical work in libraries. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that technological work in libraries was on the way out, it was that &lt;em&gt;a specific way of conducting that technical work was on the way out&lt;/em&gt;. As I&amp;rsquo;m joining the ranks of the mid-career professionals, this gave me pause. As members of Ohio&amp;rsquo;s TEDSIG community, are we actively designing a future for the next generation of library professionals to step into?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help us explore the design implications of our current and potential library futures, John Jung was invited to speak at TEDSIG 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;john_jung.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;photo of John Jung&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Jung is Design Consultant at &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnjung.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;johnjung.us&lt;/a&gt; and Programmer/Analyst at The University of Chicago. John is interested in the different ways that research and design might intersect. He has recently spoken on Speculative Design &amp;amp; Strategy at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnjung.us/scd_and_strategy.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Symposium on the Future of Libraries&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle, Washington, as well as having lead the provocatively-titled reading group &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latitudechicago.org/classes-and-workshops/reading-group-design-after-the-end-of-the-world&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Design After the End of the World&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; in his hometown of Chicago. He has a degree in art from Governors State University and a degree in design methods from the IIT Institute of Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative and Critical Design and Libraries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Moynihan once noted: &amp;ldquo;We perceive the world as anticipations of its future&amp;rdquo;. If nothing else, this statement gives us pause. Just enough of a delay to remove us from immediacy. Allowing us to bring our set of expectations and assumptions to the foreground and reflect upon how these projections of a near-term reality guide our decision-making in the present. As many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, the struggle is real. To avoid a future that merely recapitulates - both the positive and negative aspects of - our present solutions, we need to think critically about the design of our future. But maybe more so, we need a toolkit to problematize our present. To shake loose our assumptions, and provide just enough distance to consider alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where Speculative Design is useful. Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being. If it is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward, speculative design has promise as a way to allow us to problematize our present, so as not to repeat our past, by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>code{4}lib - Pittsburgh, PA</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2020code4lib/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lots-of-firsts-at-code-4-lib-2020&#34;&gt;Lots of Firsts at Code{4}lib 2020&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code{4}lib is the only major conference that I&amp;rsquo;ve attend with a single track. Most conferences are multi-track. At a multi-track conference, attendees gather for a keynote presentation to kick-off the event. But after that collective experience, everyone develops a self-selected path through simultaneously occurring presentations and activities. At Code{4}lib, all attendees experience the same sequence of sessions, lightning talks, breakouts, and keynotes presentations. There&amp;rsquo;s a definitively stronger sense of community that emerges with a single-track conference. As attendees discuss sessions - through the filters of their own local context and professional focus - a richer understanding of each topic develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference also marks the first time that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a committee for a national conference. All of my previous conference planning experiences have been either at the state, regional, or institutional-level. As a member of the Website Working Group for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://2020.code4lib.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2020 conference&lt;/a&gt;, our team focused mainly on content strategy for web properties and improving the overall experience for on-site and remote attendees, speakers, sponsors, and a host of other interested parties that will stumble upon the content in the coming weeks and months. Our team contributed a number of significant improvements to the overall accessibility of the conference website, including: (1) multiple adjustments to the document structure, (2) removing situations of skipped heading to ease screenreader traversal, and whenever possible (3) swapping static content with variable references, so that next year&amp;rsquo;s working group will be able to customize the conference website more fully by simply updating the content in the site&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;data.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another first? How about navigating the terrain when your conference coincides with the emergence of the global pandemic: &lt;strong&gt;COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;. Impossible to anticipate, but major crises highlight the spectrum of financial and logistical realities faced by any organization that hosts a national conference. Hats off to the Local Planning Committee, as they did a spectacular job of keeping on top of CDC recommendations and guiding with definitive leadership. And the Streaming Video Committee, they kept the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzGHg-1qAr4BxO2TzF9wiFcXVTEn1rRYM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;remote presentations&lt;/a&gt; connected and engaged with flawless momentum. Bravo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;food-cause-the-answer-is-always-yes&#34;&gt;Food, &amp;lsquo;Cause the Answer is Always &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ❤️ food. One of the things that I savor about visiting another city - for a conference or otherwise - are those brief moments that I actually get to experience it&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness. When I visited Portland, Oregon several years ago, the food culture was truly exceptional. Portland set a rather high bar for my future gastronomic explorations. But, a treasure can be uncovered anywhere. One pleasant surprise along my conference trek has been Minneapolis, Minnesota. Quite literally, the best breakfast tostada I&amp;rsquo;ve ever eaten was at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mercurympls.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt;, which is less than a city block from the light rail station at Nicollet Mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Pittsburgh was slightly underwhelming. I did manage to discover a tasty sandwich shop, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eat-gaucho.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gaucho&amp;rsquo;s Parrilla Argentina &lt;/a&gt; in the Strip District, and the downtown location of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nickysthaikitchen.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nicky&amp;rsquo;s Thai Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; had a refreshing ginger-infused hot sake that was entirely welcome after a full day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hotel-oddities&#34;&gt;Hotel Oddities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather large &lt;em&gt;sinkhole&lt;/em&gt; exposed the bowels of the city, and swallowed a city bus in October 2019, remained unrepaired in front of the Westin hotel.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://9b16f79ca967fd0708d1-2713572fef44aa49ec323e813b06d2d9.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/1200x/20191028dsSinkholePATBusLocal03-2-1572277030.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pittsburgh port authority bus projecting upward from a sinkhole in the middle of a downtown street&#34; title=&#34;Pittsburgh port authority bus projecting upward from a sinkhole in the middle of a downtown street&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;em&gt;elevator&lt;/em&gt; controls were&amp;hellip; um, peculiar. Rather than attempting to describe it myself, I&amp;rsquo;ll just point to the following 5 minute lightening talk that does a much better job than I can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/0URpVt0-iVQ?t=9815&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Expectations and Conventions: A code{4}lib Elevator Story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it really is a fun &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; informative talk that&amp;rsquo;s worth your next coffee break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lots-of-projects-that-i-ll-follow-up-on&#34;&gt;Lots of Projects that I&amp;rsquo;ll Follow-up on:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before heading to the conference, I was already in the process of spinning up the digital asset management system &lt;a href=&#34;https://hyku.samvera.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hyku&lt;/a&gt; on a t3-large EC2 instance. Having just finished writing a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose-ohn.yml&lt;/code&gt; file to set up an instance of Hyku behind the reverse proxy &lt;a href=&#34;https://containo.us/traefik/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Traefik&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.portainer.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Portainer&lt;/a&gt; as a container management tool, I was just beginning to explore Hyku&amp;rsquo;s possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I stopped by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://samvera.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Samvera&lt;/a&gt; community table during one the breaks for a brief chat about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hykuforconsortia.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hyku for Consortia&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.derekzoladz.com/website/post/2020code4lib/hyku_for_consortia.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo&#34; title=&#34;Hexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;{{&#34; alt=&#34;Hexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo&#34; title=&#34;hyku_for_consortia.png&amp;quot; | relURL }} &amp;quot;Hexagon-shaped sticker showing Hyku for Consortia logo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main focus of the Hyku for Consortia work is to implement a series of changes to the permissions of Hyku. While Hyku is architected as a multi-tenant application right out of the box, there is no current method to provide a group of users with the ability to work across tenants. The Hyku for Consortia project aims to create this feature to facilitate cross-consortial collaborations, as well as allowing the development of administrative governance bodies, say &amp;ldquo;a standards and review body&amp;rdquo;, which could provide guidance and assistance throughout all of the tenants hosted on a single Hyku instance. The project has partnered with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notch8.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Notch8&lt;/a&gt; out of San Diego to complete the feature development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;just-a-few-others&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; Just a Few Others&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many tools, so little time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/httptoolkit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;HTTP Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is this a mashup of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wireshark.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.telerik.com/fiddler&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fiddler&lt;/a&gt;, but more intuitive? We&amp;rsquo;ll find out soon enough :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mnylc/preservethispodcast&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Preserve this Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Likely of more interest to public libraries, setting up a DIY podcast preservation workshop might appeal to communities with an interest in audio or citizen journalism. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been much more focused on the applicability of &lt;a href=&#34;https://carpentries.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Carpentries&lt;/a&gt; workshops for academic technical services departments&amp;hellip; especially for mid-sized academic libraries located within reasonable geographic proximity to any major metropolitan area. These skills need to be acquired now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wagtail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s an open source content management system built on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.djangoproject.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;. It can be used to create simple apps that can be embedded into link resolvers, or other library platforms, to allow patrons to report missing PDFs, broken links, or other problematic content within a vendor&amp;rsquo;s platform. Input capture mechanisms can be coded using client-side Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.browserstack.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BrowserStack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Execute automated browser tests as part of a CI/CD pipeline. There&amp;rsquo;s a free-tier planning for testing open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mherrmann/helium&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An alternative to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.selenium.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; for driving a browser. Useful for application testing and automating routine chores. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to giving this tool a test drive. The simplified API appears magical.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apps I&#39;m Taking into 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2019apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2019apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s a major challenge to identify all of the scripts, command line tools, and web-based applications that have influenced my thoughts and workflow over the previous year,
here&amp;rsquo;s a set of applications that I&amp;rsquo;m excited to take with me into the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/laurent22/joplin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Built upon node.js and electron, Joplin is an open source note taking application. At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m using it as a well-structured notebook to recall quotes and collect ideas of all sorts. With the ability to sync notebooks to both &lt;a href=&#34;https://owncloud.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OwnCloud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextcloud.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NextCloud&lt;/a&gt; - as well as several other storage solutions - the availability of my notebooks across multiple OSes and environments makes it an application that I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy on many occasions in 2020+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dockstation.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dockstation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you want: (1) a gentle, graphical, introduction to engineering microservice-based applications with Docker Compose, (2) an interface to the container registry of Docker Hub, and (3) the ability to expose your container logs with the click of a button, DockStation is a wonderful gateway into the world of containers. I develop all of my &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; files using Dockstation on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-hole.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Running on a raspberry pi 3 on my home LAN, Pi-Hole provides DNS-level ad blocking on the network. I&amp;rsquo;m using Pi-hole as my DHCP server to assign IP addresses to clients on the LAN.  Via &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/dnsmasq&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dnsmasq&lt;/a&gt;, Pi-hole is also responsible for resolving a few host names on the LAN for applications like my Koha instance and backup server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While working with the Code4Lib web team on the 2020 (Pittsburgh, PA) conference website, I&amp;rsquo;ve become acquainted with this ruby-based static site generator. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; for my personal website, as well as for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://info.cool-cat.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Consortium of Ohio Libraries&lt;/a&gt; website, for roughly 2 years. Hugo has been reliable, but Jekyll as several themes for software project documentation and product marketing that have simple, yet complete, designs. I&amp;rsquo;ll likely explore these themes for other projects in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bitwarden.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As I&amp;rsquo;m currently using LastPass, I&amp;rsquo;ve only begun to evaluate the full potential of BitWarden. I prefer open source applications, but this password management solution falls into the aspirational category for the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
According to the project website, &amp;ldquo;GitLab is a complete DevOps platform&amp;rdquo;. My main reason for creating a GitLab account is to explore the broader range of open source projects, whose primary source code repository might live within the GitLab ecosystem. As an example, the Evergreen ILS community writes documentation using &lt;a href=&#34;http://asciidoc.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Asciidoc&lt;/a&gt;. Experiments have begun using &lt;a href=&#34;https://antora.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Antora&lt;/a&gt; for generating Evergreen documentation. Antora&amp;rsquo;s source code resides on GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Curses, It&#39;s Glances</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/glances/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/glances/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s definitely an argument to be made for using lightweight apps that minimize installed dependencies in an effort to: (1) minimize the surface area for vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and (2) reduce application complexity for  troubleshooting purposes when something inevitably goes wrong. However, there needs to be a balance between security gains and pleasure in using an application, what&amp;rsquo;s the point in installing it in the first place if you aren&amp;rsquo;t going to use it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An application that sits in the sweet spot is &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Glances&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glances uses a plugin archiecture. The documentation contains a &lt;a href=&#34;https://glances.readthedocs.io/en/stable/aoa/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;current list of available plugins&lt;/a&gt;. One of the plugins that deserves highlighting is the AMP (Application Monitoring Process) plugin. AMPs are simple regex statements written into the Glances main &lt;code&gt;glances.conf&lt;/code&gt; configuration file that allow the user to monitor any running processes. Glances configuration file is written in the human readable INI format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On macOS Catalina, I&amp;rsquo;m using Homebrew as my package manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;brew install glances
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it. Simple. But if you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to adjust the default configuration. The glances directory does not exist by default, so you’ll also need to create it by doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;mkdir /usr/local/etc/glances
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;cat /usr/local/Cellar/glances/3.1.3/share/doc/glances/glances.conf &amp;gt; /usr/local/etc/glances/glances.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keybindings-interactive-commands&#34;&gt;Keybindings (Interactive Commands)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sampling of the in-app toggles that I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;D&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;show/hide Docker module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;A&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;show/hide AMPs module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;&amp;#8592;&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;move through Tasks menus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;h&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;show Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;n&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;show/hide Networks module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;1&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;toggle global CPU and per-CPU stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;2&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;show/hide left sidebar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;kbd&gt;5&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;strong&gt;show/hide top menu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;follow-up&#34;&gt;Follow up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://glances.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ReadTheDocs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glances provides several export options for statistical data. One option is Elasticsearch. Indexing the usage data from macOS to be visualized in Kibana running on localhost is a likely next step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overview of My Personal Library</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/my_library/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Oct 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/my_library/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a day-to-day basis, I work with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://info.cool-cat.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Consortium of Ohio Libraries&lt;/a&gt; on their open-source ILS &lt;a href=&#34;https://evergreen-ils.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Evergreen&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s configuring new circulation policies, adjusting global system settings, or writing SQL to batch update item attributes, I&amp;rsquo;ve explored a significant chunk of Evergreen over the last 3 years. But it&amp;rsquo;s an understatment to say that Evergreen is a massive application. There&amp;rsquo;s still plenty of uncharted functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evergreen&amp;rsquo;s architecture is designed for multi-tenancy out-of-the-box and built to scale to very large consortia. In the United States, it&amp;rsquo;s the platform for a number of large public library consortia. For a personal library, it&amp;rsquo;s overkill. Developing a personal library is also an opportunity to explore the setup and administer another ILS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, I chose another well-known open source ILS used most often by stand-alone public libraries as the foundation for my personal library: &lt;a href=&#34;https://koha-community.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Koha&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals for the personal library projected included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low stakes copy and original MARC cataloging experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing data migration skills (e.g. Koha to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.folio.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FOLIO&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversifying my ILS administration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and build ILS infrastructure and networking from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be cataloging my personal collection of library-related books on my local network using the following hardware.

      <title>Why ls is exa</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/exa/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/exa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common commands that I execute in the terminal is simply to list the contents of a directory. Since I do this so often, being able to quickly and easily digest vast amounts of information about the content of the directory is essential. That&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;a href=&#34;https://the.exa.website/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exa&lt;/a&gt; shines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out-of-the-box, the default color scheme of &lt;code&gt;exa&lt;/code&gt; is finely tuned. I found the intricate use of subtle color distinctions distracting, rather than informative. As such, I would need to modify the color definitions to suit my personal goals of: (1) being able to easily differentiate between directory content that my current user owns or is a member of the assigned group, (2) rapidly distinguish between files and directories, and (3) generally list common metadata elements that experiencing has shown to be frequently useful in troubleshooting an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# ------------------------------
# exa - Color Scheme Definitions
# ------------------------------

export EXA_COLORS=&amp;quot;\
da=38;5;245:\
di=38;5;14:\
sn=38;5;28:\
sb=38;5;28:\
uu=38;5;40:\
un=38;5;160:\
gu=38;5;40:\
gn=38:5:160:\
bl=38;5;220:\
ur=37:\
uw=37:\
ux=37:\
ue=37:\
gr=37:\
gw=37:\
gx=37:\
tr=37:\
tw=37:\
tx=37:\
su=37:\
sf=37:\
xa=37&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;exa&lt;/code&gt; has a wide range of configurable settings and features. After barely scratching the surface of exa&amp;rsquo;s functionality, I&amp;rsquo;ve configured a tool that lists directory contents in a clear, and highly meaningful way, that fits my workflow. &lt;a href=&#34;https://the.exa.website/features&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;exa&amp;rsquo;s documentation&lt;/a&gt; provides adequate description to customize output to fix various use cases. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m not using any of the git integration, extended attributes, or unix-like tree expansion of the file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what am I using? Well&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s spelled out in the &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; alias in my &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;alias ls=&amp;quot;exa --long --header --links  --inode --blocks --accessed --modified --created --group --all --sort=.name  --group-directories-first&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Farewell, Nano</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/farewell_nano/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/farewell_nano/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forever, I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt; as my command-line text editor. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had an issue with it. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s been so reliable that I&amp;rsquo;ve keep it around much longer than I should have. It still works well for most of my needs, but it&amp;rsquo;s time to expand my suite of skills and learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m switching to &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out-of-the-box, &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;tabula rasa&lt;/em&gt;, a blank slate, and it feels oddly empty. To fill this vacuum, my first step in making the transition was to explore plugin managers. Of course, this is following an introductory period to learn the basics. If I was going to successfully make the switch, I was going to need to first personalize my instance &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I selected Tim Pope&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pathogen.vim&lt;/a&gt; as my plugin manager. &lt;code&gt;pathogen.vim&lt;/code&gt; allows for each plugin to be placed into its own version-controlled directory and loaded at runtime. Installing a plugin is straightforward: &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;~/.vim/bundle/&lt;/code&gt;. Simple, maintainable, elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the plugins that comprise my base:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;jellybeans.vim&lt;/a&gt;: Because everyone needs a cheerful, dark-mode enabled, color scheme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;nerdtree.vim&lt;/a&gt;: If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be using &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; for any amount of time, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to have a file explorer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fugitive.vim&lt;/a&gt;: A way more advanced git wrapper than I currently need, but a rich avenue for exploration and growth. I&amp;rsquo;m basically using this plugin to display git information in the &lt;code&gt;&#39;statusline&#39;&lt;/code&gt; via&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lightline.vim&lt;/a&gt;: In a nutshell, an easy to use and highly configurable &lt;code&gt;&#39;statusline&#39;&lt;/code&gt; plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to take &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dzoladz/.vim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my initial configuration&lt;/a&gt; for a spin!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apps I&#39;m Taking into 2019</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2018apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.derekzoladz.com/post/2018apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I should probably start off with a bit of a caveat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. Now that we have that out of the way, here are a few of the apps that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered over the last 365 days that I&amp;rsquo;ll be taking with me into 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PyCharm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PyCharm is a Python IDE with an extensive collection of plugins. I&amp;rsquo;m using the community edition to develop Python scripts in support the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, mainly to interact with the Evergreen ILS. PyCharm includes a useful testing suite and refactoring tools, while also providing straightforward integration with GitHub and seamless implementation of pipenv virtual environments. Simple on-boarding for new python developers, but feature rich and extensible as your needs grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iterm2.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Essentially, a terminal replacement for the native terminal application that shipped with my MacBook Pro. I find the ability to split terminal panes both vertically and horizontally an advantage for different tasks. I&amp;rsquo;ve also made use of the integrated search feature quite a bit. With colorized output, it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful to use. There are also a slew of other powerful features that I rarely make use of (in 2018, at least).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sequelpro.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sequel Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A MacOS native application for interacting with MySQL and MariaDB and a replacement phpMyAdmin. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DB browser for SQLite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Open source application to create and edit SQLite database files. My main use case is to import Excel worksheets and be able to execute SQL commands on the data. Maybe more importantly is the ability to import multiple Excel worksheets, join them together, and query across them. This tool said me quite a bit of time when working with the Academic Library Association of Ohio (ALAO) this past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://brave.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A web browser built on Chromium and the Blink rendering engine, a fork of WebKit. It&amp;rsquo;s my drop-in replacement for Google Chrome at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oh My Zsh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned Bash and began using the Z shell on my MacBook Pro. I&amp;rsquo;m a very big fan of the available themes, which have assisted with git workflow and generally made working in the terminal a much more pleasant and enjoyable experience. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/berick/pysip2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PySip2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Python-based SIP 2 client that has been invaluable this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this tool for testing SIP connectivity during the statewide implementation of Lynda.com, while establishing authentication for the Ohio Digital Library, for new subscriptions to Hoopla, and also while implementing a PC management system at one on the COOL libraries. Outstanding little application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Participating in the early group for the technical infrastructure for this project - simply called &amp;lsquo;DPLA Ohio&amp;rsquo; at the time - shaped the trajectory of my career firmly towards technology. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://library.ohio.gov/news/ohio-digital-network-collections-debuts-dpla/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;State Library of Ohio&amp;rsquo;s announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Augmented Reality at Columbus State Library [Photo Essay]</title>
      <link>https://www.derekzoladz.com/project/thurgood/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court&lt;/em&gt; was an interactive exhibit at the Columbus State Library in 2015. Posters were brought to life using the augmented reality app &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aurasma.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Aurasma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using emerging technology, team members created the exhibit and online guide that was enjoyed and appreciated by the community, ranging from 5th graders to local business leaders. With the help of many collaborators, the team went beyond the exhibit to create a wide range of programs including a film series, an art exhibit, a lecture series, and a companion display and programming in the Bookstore. This innovative and extraordinary program of exhibits and events provided the campus and community with the opportunity to learn more deeply about events and individuals that have had an impact on the way we live today.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;strong&gt;CSCC Quality Team Award, Gold 2016&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

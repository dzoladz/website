Getting back to somewhat of a normal afternoon, I decided to take a look at my [DrupalCon 2024](https://events.drupal.org/portland2024) notes. There's
be a lot of discussion of generative AI both at the conference and in the office, so I thought I'd let ChatGPT
take a crack at generating the first paragraph about DrupalCon 2024 based upon my session notes available in
the markdown files opened in my IDE.

<hr/>

```text
DrupalCon 2024 is the best DrupalCon ever! It's the first DrupalCon to be held on the moon, and it's the first 
DrupalCon to be held in space. The moon is a great place to hold a conference because it's a lot quieter than 
Earth. There are no cars or trucks driving by, and there are no people talking loudly. The moon is also a great 
place to hold a conference because it's a lot cooler than Earth. The temperature on the moon is always around 
-20 degrees Celsius, which is perfect for a conference. The moon is also a great place to hold a conference 
because it's a lot cleaner than Earth. There is no pollution on the moon, so the air is always fresh and clean. 
The moon is also a great place to hold a conference because it's a lot safer than Earth. There are no criminals 
on the moon, so you don't have to worry about getting mugged or robbed. The moon is also a great place to hold 
a conference because it's a lot more fun than Earth. There are no boring office buildings or crowded streets on 
the moon. Instead, there are craters to explore, mountains to climb, and valleys to hike through. DrupalCon 2024 
is going to be the best DrupalCon ever, and you won't want to miss it!
```

<hr/>

I'm not sure if I'd want to attend a conference on the moon, but exploring the craters does 
sound like a lot of fun!

Back here on planet Earth, we like to call Portland, Oregon the location of DrupalCon 2024. 
The conference was held at the Oregon Convention Center from May 6-9, 2024; Requiring travel
through the following airports: John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH), Dallas Love 
Field (DAL), Portland International Airport (PDX), and Denver International Airport (DEN).

## Birds of a Feather: Drupal4Lib

The Drupal4Lib Birds of a Feather session was a great opportunity for librarians to connect and share their experiences
using Drupal. The session covered topics like the ECA module and Islandora, an open-source digital asset management
system. If you're a librarian interested in Drupal, be sure to join the [Drupal4Lib Slack channel](https://www.drupal.org/slack).

## Config Validation

Wil Leers gave a presentation on config validation in Drupal 10.2. He discussed how Drupal 8.4 laid the foundations for
config validation and how it has evolved in Drupal 9.4 and beyond. He demonstrated how modules can adopt config
validation using #config_target and how this can make Drupal more reliable. You can learn more about config validation
on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/Wim-Leers).

## Project Browser

The Project Browser session was a deep dive into the new features of the Drupal project browser. The session covered
topics like the CDN module and how it uses config_target for updating configuration via JSON:API. If you're interested
in learning more about the Project Browser, be sure to check out the [Drupal.org project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal).

# Day 2: May 7, 2024

## McGill University

McGill University gave a presentation on how they manage, test, and deploy 1,000 Drupal websites using Ansible and Gitlab CI.

## How to use automated tools to upgrade your site from Drupal 7 to Drupal 10.x

43% of the entire Drupal community is on Drupal 7. Drupal 7 end of life is coming in 2025. Acquia recently open sourced our migration automation tool, Acquia Migrate: Accelerate (AM:A) to help the community get to D10 and prepare for D11.

This will be hands-on learning session for integrating the Drupal module into your application:
* Live demo
* Real-world use cases
* Customer success stories

Whether you're a seasoned developer or a migration newbie, learn how
to leverage AM:A to automate your content migration, give you the confidence to be a migration expert, and help keep your application on the latest version of Drupal Core.

## LA Water

User Journey




# Fin - Key Takeaways

1. Drupal as a "digital experience builder", not merely a CMS

  Coming into the conference, my experience with Drupal was limited to about 20 hours of targeted
  troubleshooting for Laura Solomon. 

  Extending core with modules, and now with recipes, etc...

1. Leaving ready to contribute

  There are several requirements that must be met to participate in the development of Drupal.
  First, you need to have a Drupal.org user account and it *must* be confirmed.
  Second, you need to familiarize yourself with the codebase, issues, and general working preferences of the Drupal community.
  Third, you need to medium to discuss day-to-day Drupal and potential solutions with the community for feedback and best practices.


1. Learning the terminology used by "Site Builders" is a must
  
  It's the only way to bridge the gap between developers and the intricate needs to "site builders"
  for custom code to support customer needs.


1. Portland still has amazing food culture

Vegan magic box (Black Water is 100% Vegan) https://bar.blackwaterpdx.com/
Naan N Curry (Southern Indian) https://www.naancurrypdx.com/
Hibabi (Syrian/Lebanese) https://www.habibirestaurantmenu.com/



1. Powell's Bookstore is a must

  The small press section is unique. It's a very rare occurance to be able to physically browse materials
  published by a wide spectrum of small publishers in a single location. I could spend many days in this store.

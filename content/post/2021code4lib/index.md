To improve the overall experience for users (e.g., all attendees, speakers, potential sponsors, post-conference users), our charge was to focus on content strategy and new feature implementations for the first ever fully-online Code4Lib conference.

### Major Contributions

After the routine maintanence and generalized updating the occurs as a conference website moves through the phases of its purpose and utility to conference attendees, there are three areas of focused improvement.

#### Dark Mode

With the 2021 conference being fully online and remote, we didn't have the host city's skyline to guide the tone and choice of colors for the theme.
During our initial 
we attempted to retain a sense of place by proposing the use of a fictional city, but eventually settled on a vibrant pastel palette with geometric design.
Doing so provided us with an opportunity to create a 'dark mode', creating the overall look-and-feel for the site that was reminisent of a 1980s roller rink.

#### Design Page

### Conference T-Shirt
Directly influenced by the geometric theme of this year's conference website, the winning t-shirt design prominently displayed the icosahedron.

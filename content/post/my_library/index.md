On a day-to-day basis, I work with the [Consortium of Ohio Libraries](http://info.cool-cat.org/) on their open-source ILS [Evergreen](https://evergreen-ils.org/).
Evergreen's architecture is designed for multi-tenancy and to scale to very large consortia. For a personal library, it's overkill.
Developing a personal library is an opportunity to explore the administration of another open-source ILS.

For my personal library, I chose another well-known open source ILS used by numerous public libraries in the United States: [Koha](https://koha-community.org/).

Goals for the projected included:
* copy and original MARC cataloging experience
* experiments with data migration (more on this later)
* diversify system administration 
* infrastructue and networking

* Personal collection of library-related books... and metadata

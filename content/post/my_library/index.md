On a day-to-day basis, I work with the [Consortium of Ohio Libraries](http://info.cool-cat.org/) on their open-source ILS [Evergreen](https://evergreen-ils.org/).
Evergreen's architecture is designed for multi-tenancy and to scale to very large consortia. For a personal library, it's overkill.
Developing a personal library is an opportunity to explore the administration of another open-source ILS.

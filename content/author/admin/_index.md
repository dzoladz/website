Strong advocate for the use of open source technologies in day-to-day library operations. Heavily involved with ILS system management, data (and metadata) wrangling, server administration, process automation, and a host of other technical odds-and-ends for the [Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL)](http://info.cool-cat.org/), [Ohio Private Academic Libraries (OPAL)](https://opal-libraries.org/), and the [Private Academic Library Network of Indiana (PALNI)](https://www.palni.org/).

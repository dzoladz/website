*Thurgood Marshall and the Supreme Court* was an interactive exhibit at the Columbus State Library in 2015. Posters were brought to life using the augmented reality app [Aurasma](https://www.aurasma.com/).

> "Using emerging technology, team members created the exhibit and online guide that was enjoyed and appreciated by the community, ranging from 5th graders to local business leaders. With the help of many collaborators, the team went beyond the exhibit to create a wide range of programs including a film series, an art exhibit, a lecture series, and a companion display and programming in the Bookstore. This innovative and extraordinary program of exhibits and events provided the campus and community with the opportunity to learn more deeply about events and individuals that have had an impact on the way we live today." - **CSCC Quality Team Award, Gold 2016**

abstract = "Rather than fussing with the overhead and time investment required to maintain a suite of custom scripts to gain deeper insight into EZproxy usage, take advantage of the cumulative efforts of EZproxy users from around the world. In this presentation, the presenter will demonstrate the use of ezPAARSE, an open-source application for ingesting, parsing, deduplicating, and enriching EZproxy log files for standardized analysis. Attendees will leave with an understanding of the utility of ezPAARSE and the knowledge required to begin using ezPAARSE to extract a more rich and finer-grained set of insights from usage activity."
